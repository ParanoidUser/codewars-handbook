# [Herding cats](https://www.codewars.com/kata/herding-cats "https://www.codewars.com/kata/54abfb827207c6355e00035b")

In this kata, you will be creating a Java ```Comparator``` to sort cats by their weight.

The ```Cat``` class is preloaded for you., and its signature is given below:
```java
public class Cat implements Comparable<Cat>
{
  public String name;
  public double weight;
  
  public Cat(String name, double weight);
  
  @Override
  public int compareTo(Cat c);
  
  @Override
  public boolean equals(Object o);
}
```
In the tests, an array of cats will be populated, and then sorted using ```Arrays.sort()```.
By default, this will sort the cats by their names. Your job is to complete the implementation of ```CatWeightComparator``` so that the cats are sorted by weight.

You may assume that no two cats have the same name.

For more information about ```Arrays```, take a look at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html.
