The greatest enemy of all programmers is ";".
Very often we forgot about this symbol.
Also, we can forget about closing brackets (If we don't use IDE that closes brackets for us).

Task: to make a method which will check if the brackets "(","{","[" have a couple ")","}","]".

For example: "(hello everybody)" -> true;

"} - bracket" -> false;

"[1] - the first example without (" -> false;
