# [Insert dashes](https://www.codewars.com/kata/insert-dashes "https://www.codewars.com/kata/55960bbb182094bc4800007b")

Write a function `insertDash(num)`/`InsertDash(int num)` that will insert dashes ('-') between each two odd numbers in num. For example: if num is 454793 the output should be 4547-9-3. Don't count zero as an odd number.

Note that the number will always be non-negative (>= 0).
