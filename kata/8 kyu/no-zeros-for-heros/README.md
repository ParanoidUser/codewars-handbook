# [No zeros for heroes](https://www.codewars.com/kata/no-zeros-for-heros "https://www.codewars.com/kata/570a6a46455d08ff8d001002")

Numbers ending with zeros are boring.

They might be fun in your world, but not here.

Get rid of them. Only the ending ones.

    1450 -> 145
    960000 -> 96
    1050 -> 105
    -1050 -> -105
    
Zero alone is fine, don't worry about it. Poor guy anyway
