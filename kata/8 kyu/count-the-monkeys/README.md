# [Count the Monkeys!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/count-the-monkeys "56f69d9f9400f508fb000ba7")

You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1.

As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero.

For example:
```
monkeyCount(10) // --> new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
monkeyCount(1) // --> new int[]{1}
```
