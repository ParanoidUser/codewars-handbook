# Kata Task


You are given a list of cogs in a <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear_train">gear train</a>

Each element represents the number of teeth of that cog

e.g. `[100, 75]` means 
* 1st cog has 100 teeth 
* 2nd cog has 75 teeth

If the first cog rotates clockwise at 1 RPM what is the RPM of the final cog? 

(use negative numbers for anti-clockwise rotation)


# Notes

* no two cogs share the same shaft
