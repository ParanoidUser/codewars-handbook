# üçï Pizza Party #1 - How many pizzas do we need

---

## **Description**

You're at a party, everything is great, and everyone wants pizza. But there's a twist‚Äînobody agrees on how to count pizza slices! One person says he need `1/2` slices of pizza, another says `3/4`, and someone boldly declares `10/12`. 

Your mission: ensure everyone gets their requested slices by calculating how many **whole pizzas** to order. Remember, you can only order **complete pizzas**‚Äîno partial ones!

---

## **Example**

Person 1 wants `3/4` of a pizza.
This means they want three out of the four slices that make up one whole pizza.

Person 2 wants `5/4` of a pizza.
This means they want more than one full pizza. In fact, they want one whole pizza `(4/4)` plus an additional slice, making a total of `5/4`.

Now, let's add the slices together: 3/4 + 5/4 = 8/4. This means the total amount of pizza needed is equivalent to two full pizzas (since 8/4 = 2).
