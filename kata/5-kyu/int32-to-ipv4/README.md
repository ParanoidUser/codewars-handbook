# [int32 to IPv4](https://www.codewars.com/kata/int32-to-ipv4 "https://www.codewars.com/kata/52e88b39ffb6ac53a400022e")

Take the following IPv4 address: `128.32.10.1`

This address has 4 octets where each octet is a single byte (or 8 bits).

* 1st octet `128` has the binary representation: `10000000`
* 2nd octet `32` has the binary representation: `00100000`
* 3rd octet `10` has the binary representation: `00001010`
* 4th octet `1` has the binary representation: `00000001`

So `128.32.10.1` == `10000000.00100000.00001010.00000001`

Because the above IP address has 32 bits, we can represent it as the unsigned 32-bit
number: `2149583361`

Complete the function that takes an unsigned 32-bit number and returns a string representation of
its IPv4 address.

## Examples

```
2149583361 ==> "128.32.10.1"
32         ==> "0.0.0.32"
0          ==> "0.0.0.0"
```
