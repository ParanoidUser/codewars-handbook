Hey Codewarrior!

You already implemented a <b>Cube</b> class, but now we need your help again! I'm talking about constructors. We don't have one. Let's code
one (or more) such that one can instantiate an object via it, handling either no arguments or a single integer.

Also, we got a problem with negative values. Correct the code so negative values will be switched to positive ones!

The constructor taking no arguments should assign 0 to Cube's Side property.
