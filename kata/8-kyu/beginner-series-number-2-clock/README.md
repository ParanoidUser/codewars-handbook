# [Beginner Series #2 Clock](https://www.codewars.com/kata/beginner-series-number-2-clock "https://www.codewars.com/kata/55f9bca8ecaa9eac7100004a")

Clock shows 'h' hours, 'm' minutes and 's' seconds after midnight.

Your task is to make 'Past' function which returns time converted to miliseconds.

#####Example:

```
Past(0, 1, 1) == 61000
```

Note! h, m and s will be only Natural numbers! 
Waiting for translations and Feedback! Thanks!
