# [So Many Permutations!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/so-many-permutations "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5254ca2719453dcc0b00027d")

In this kata, your task is to create all permutations of a non-empty input string and remove
duplicates, if present.

Create as many "shufflings" as you can!

Examples:

```
With input 'a':
Your function should return: ['a']

With input 'ab':
Your function should return ['ab', 'ba']

With input 'abc':
Your function should return ['abc','acb','bac','bca','cab','cba']

With input 'aabb':
Your function should return ['aabb', 'abab', 'abba', 'baab', 'baba', 'bbaa']
```

Note: The order of the permutations doesn't matter.
