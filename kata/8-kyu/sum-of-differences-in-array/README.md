# [Sum of differences in array](https://www.codewars.com/kata/sum-of-differences-in-array "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b73fe9fb3d9776fbf00009e")

Your task is to sum the differences between consecutive pairs in the array in descending order.

For example: `sumOfDifferences([2, 1, 10])`
Returns `9`

Descending order: `[10, 2, 1]`

Sum: `(10 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 8 + 1 = 9`

If the array is empty or the array has only one element the result should be `0` (Nothing in Haskell).
