# [Predict your age!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/predict-your-age "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5aff237c578a14752d0035ae")

My grandfather always predicted how old people would get, and right before he passed away he revealed his secret!

In honor of my grandfather's memory we will write a function using his formula!

* Take a list of ages when each of your great-grandparent died.  
* Multiply each number by itself.  
* Add them all together.  
* Take the square root of the result.  
* Divide by two.

## Example

```
predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) === 86
```

Note: the result should be rounded down to the nearest integer.

Some random tests might fail due to a bug in the JavaScript implementation. Simply resubmit if that happens to you.
