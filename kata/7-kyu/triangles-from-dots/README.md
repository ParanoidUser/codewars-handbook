# [Triangles from Dots](https://www.codewars.com/kata/triangles-from-dots "https://www.codewars.com/kata/59873d50c54a075e67000038")

In this simple kata you need to find how many dots are needed to construct `n`th triangle in the sequence of dot triangles. See next image to get the idea of the sequence:
