# [Beginner Series #4 Cockroach](https://www.codewars.com/kata/beginner-series-number-4-cockroach "https://www.codewars.com/kata/55fab1ffda3e2e44f00000c6")

The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer (= floored).

For example:
```
cockroachSpeed(1.08) == 30
```

Note! The input is a Real number (actual type is language dependent) and is >= 0. The result should be an Integer.
