Your task is very simple, I need to know if I can ring up my friend or not, I travel a lot and my
friends too. So I will give you my local date and time also where I'm and where is my friend. Your
task is to give me date and time where he is.

## Notes

* the input format of date and time is "dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm", 23h clock

## Example

My date and time is 26-03-2021 19:41 and a live-in Europe/Warsaw, my friend right now is in
Africa/Asmara so his current data and time is: 27-03-2021 21:41
