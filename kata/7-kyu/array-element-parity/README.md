# [Array element parity](https://www.codewars.com/kata/array-element-parity "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a092d9e46d843b9db000064")

In this Kata, you will be given an array of integers whose elements have both a negative and a positive value, except for one integer that is either only negative or only positive. Your task will be to find that integer. 

Examples:

`[1, -1, 2, -2, 3] => 3`

`3` has no matching negative appearance

`[-3, 1, 2, 3, -1, -4, -2] => -4`

`-4` has no matching positive appearance

`[1, -1, 2, -2, 3, 3] => 3`

(the only-positive or only-negative integer may appear more than once)
