# [C.Wars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/cwars "https://www.codewars.com/kata/55968ab32cf633c3f8000008")

Normally we have first name, middle and the last name but there may be more than one word in a name. Like a South indian one.
Similar to those kinda names we need to initialize the names.

See the pattern Below
```
initials('code wars') => returns C.Wars 
initials('Barack Hussain obama') => returns B.H.Obama 
```
Complete the function initials.
