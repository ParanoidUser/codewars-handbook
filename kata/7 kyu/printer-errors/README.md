# [Printer Errors](https://www.codewars.com/kata/printer-errors "https://www.codewars.com/kata/56541980fa08ab47a0000040")

In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes
the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity,
are named with letters from `a to m`. 

The colors used by the printer are
recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be
`aaabbbbhaijjjm` meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times
color b, one time color h then one time color a...

Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" 
control string is produced e.g. `aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm` with letters not from `a to m`.

You have to write a function `printer_error` which given a string will output
the error rate of the printer as a **string** representing a rational whose numerator 
is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string.
Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters 
from `a`to `z`.

#Examples:
```
s="aaabbbbhaijjjm"
error_printer(s) => "0/14"

s="aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"
error_printer(s) => "8/22"

```
