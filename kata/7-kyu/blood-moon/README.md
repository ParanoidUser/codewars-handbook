Alan is going to watch the Blood Moon (lunar eclipse) tonight for the first time in his life. But his
mother, who is a history teacher, thinks the Blood Moon comes with an evil intent. The ancient Inca
people interpreted the deep red coloring as a jaguar attacking and eating the moon. But who
believes in Inca myths these days? So, Alan decides to prove to her mom that there is no jaguar.
How? Well, only little Alan knows that. For now, he needs a small help from you. Help him solve the
following calculations so that he gets enough time to prove it before the eclipse starts.

Three semicircles are drawn on `$ \overline{AB}$`, `$ \overline{AD}$`, and `$ \overline{AF}$`.

The following are true:

* `C` is the midpoint `AB`
* `CD` is perpendicular to `AB`
* `CF` is perpendicular to `AD`

## Task

Given the radius of the semicircle `ADBCA`, find out the area of the lune `AGFHA` (the shaded area).
