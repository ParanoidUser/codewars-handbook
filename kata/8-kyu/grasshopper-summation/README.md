# [Grasshopper - Summation](https://www.codewars.com/kata/grasshopper-summation "https://www.codewars.com/kata/55d24f55d7dd296eb9000030")

Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

For example:
```
summation(2) -> 3
1 + 2

summation(8) -> 36
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8
```
