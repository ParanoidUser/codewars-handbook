# [Calculate mean and concatenate string](https://www.codewars.com/kata/calculate-mean-and-concatenate-string "https://www.codewars.com/kata/56f7493f5d7c12d1690000b6")

You will be given an array which will include both integers and characters. 

Return an array of length 2 with a[0] representing the mean of the ten integers as a floating point number. There will always be 10 integers and 10 characters. Create a single string with the characters and return it as a[1] while maintaining the original order.

```
lst = ['u', '6', 'd', '1', 'i', 'w', '6', 's', 't', '4', 'a', '6', 'g', '1', '2', 'w', '8', 'o', '2', '0']
```

Here is an example of your return 

```
[3.6, "udiwstagwo"]
```
In C# and Java the mean return is a double.
