# [Simple beads count](https://www.codewars.com/kata/simple-beads-count "https://www.codewars.com/kata/58712dfa5c538b6fc7000569")

Two red beads are placed between every two blue beads. There are N blue beads. After looking at the arrangement below work out the number of red beads.
<p>
<span style="color: blue; ">@</span>
<span style="color: red; ">@</span><span style="color: red; ">@</span>
<span style="color: blue; ">@</span>
<span style="color: red; ">@</span><span style="color: red; ">@</span>
<span style="color: blue; ">@</span>
<span style="color: red; ">@</span><span style="color: red; ">@</span>
<span style="color: blue; ">@</span>
<span style="color: red; ">@</span><span style="color: red; ">@</span>
<span style="color: blue; ">@</span>
<span style="color: red; ">@</span><span style="color: red; ">@</span>
<span style="color: blue; ">@</span>  
</p>
<p>Implement <code>count_red_beads(n)</code> (in PHP <code>count_red_beads($n)</code>; in Java, Javascript, TypeScript, C, C++ <code>countRedBeads(n)</code>) so that it returns the number of <span style="color: red; ">red</span> beads.<br>
If there are less than 2 blue beads return 0.
