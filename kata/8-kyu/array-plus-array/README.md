# [Array plus array](https://www.codewars.com/kata/array-plus-array "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a2be17aee1aaefe2a000151")

I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays...actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.
