# [Becoming a Real spy](https://www.codewars.com/kata/becoming-a-real-spy "https://www.codewars.com/kata/587bdb09289b362ff50000e4")

This is the final test of becoming a spy. We played with bits of plain text & password with special XOR and finally got an encrypted text.

Let's say you put your hands on a secret email which Donald Trump sent to Hillary Clinton, you know 3 things regarding this email:

1. It is encrypted with our Ancestors blowfish encryption.
2. The plain text was in english.
3. The password was in english.


You don't know the password, you don't know its length, you don't know why the hell Donald Trump wrote secret email to Hillary Clinton...

A real spy can decrypt it.
