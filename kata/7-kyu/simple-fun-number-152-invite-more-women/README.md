# [Simple Fun #152: Invite More Women?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/simple-fun-number-152-invite-more-women "https://www.codewars.com/kata/58acfe4ae0201e1708000075")

 King Arthur and his knights are having a New Years party. Last year Lancelot was jealous of Arthur, because Arthur had a date and Lancelot did not, and they started a duel.

 To prevent this from happening again, Arthur wants to make sure there are at least as many women as men at this year's party. He gave you a list of integers of all the party goers. 
 
 Arthur needs you to return true if he needs to invite more women or false if he is all set.

## Input/Output

 - `[input]` integer array `L` (`$a` in PHP)

  An array (guaranteed non-associative in PHP) representing the genders of the attendees, where `-1` represents `women` and `1` represents `men`.
  
  `2 <= L.length <= 50`

- `[output]` a boolean value

  `true` if Arthur need to invite more women, `false` otherwise.
