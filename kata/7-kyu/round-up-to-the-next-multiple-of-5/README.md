Given an integer as input, can you round it to the next (meaning, "higher") 5?

Examples:

    input:    output:
    0    ->   0
    2    ->   5
    3    ->   5
    12   ->   15
    21   ->   25
    30   ->   30
    -2   ->   0
    -5   ->   -5
    etc.


Input may be any positive or negative integer (including 0).

You can assume that all inputs are valid integers.
