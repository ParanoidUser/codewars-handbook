# [ORing arrays](https://www.codewars.com/kata/oring-arrays "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5ac5e9aa3853da25d9000102")

It started as a discussion with a friend, who didn't fully grasp some way of setting defaults, but I thought the idea was cool enough for a beginner kata: binary `OR` each matching element of two given arrays (or lists, if you do it in Python; vectors in c++) of integers and give the resulting ORed array [starts to sound like a tonguetwister, doesn't it?].

If one array is shorter than the other, use the optional third parametero (defaulted to `0`) to `OR` the unmatched elements.

For example:

```
orArrays([1,2,3],[1,2,3]) == [1,2,3]
orArrays([1,2,3],[4,5,6]) == [5,7,7]
orArrays([1,2,3],[1,2]) == [1,2,3]
orArrays([1,2],[1,2,3]) == [1,2,3]
orArrays([1,2,3],[1,2,3],3) == [1,2,3]
```
