# [Simple Fun #2: Circle of Numbers](https://www.codewars.com/kata/simple-fun-number-2-circle-of-numbers "https://www.codewars.com/kata/58841cb52a077503c4000015")

# Task
Consider integer numbers from 0 to n - 1 written down along the circle in such a way that the distance between any two neighbouring numbers is equal (note that 0 and n - 1 are neighbouring, too).

Given `n` and `firstNumber`/`first_number`, find the number which is written in the radially opposite position to firstNumber.

# Example

 For n = 10 and firstNumber = 2, the output should be

```
CircleOfNumbers.circleOfNumbers(n, firstNumber) == 7
```
