# [Sum of two lowest positive integers](https://www.codewars.com/kata/sum-of-two-lowest-positive-integers "https://www.codewars.com/kata/558fc85d8fd1938afb000014")

Create a function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 positive integers.
No floats or non-positive integers will be passed.

```
For Java, those integers will come as double precision (long).
```

For example, when an array is passed like `[19, 5, 42, 2, 77]`, the output should be `7`.

`[10, 343445353, 3453445, 3453545353453]` should return `3453455`.
