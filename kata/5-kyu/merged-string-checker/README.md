# [Merged String Checker](https://www.codewars.com/kata/merged-string-checker "https://www.codewars.com/kata/54c9fcad28ec4c6e680011aa")

At a job interview, you are challenged to write an algorithm to check if a given string, `s`, can be formed from two
other strings, `part1` and `part2`.

The restriction is that the characters in `part1` and `part2` should be in the same order as in `s`.

The interviewer gives you the following example and tells you to figure out the rest from the given test cases.

For example:

```
'codewars' is a merge from 'cdw' and 'oears':

    s:  c o d e w a r s   = codewars
part1:  c   d   w         = cdw
part2:    o   e   a r s   = oears
```
