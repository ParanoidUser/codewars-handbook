You're given an origin point, and a list of points. These points are in a two-dimensional plane. Each point has x & y coordinates.

You've to simply return point(s) from the list that is/are nearest to the origin.

If multiple points are at the same distance from the origin, return all of those points.

Note:
A Point class is preloaded for you. You may want to leverage following instance method from the class for Java.

```public double distanceTo(Point other)```

It calculates and returns a distance between the point object & the
point object passed in the argument.
