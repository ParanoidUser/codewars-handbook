# [How many pages in a book?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/how-many-pages-in-a-book "https://www.codewars.com/kata/622de76d28bf330057cd6af8")

Every book has `n` pages with page numbers `1` to `n`. The `summary` is made by adding up the **
number of digits** of all page numbers.

Task: Given the `summary`, find the number of pages `n` the book has.

### Example

If the input is `summary=25`, then the output must be `n=17`: The numbers 1 to 17 have 25 digits in
total: `1234567891011121314151617`.

Be aware that you'll get enormous books having up to 100.000 pages.

All inputs will be valid.
