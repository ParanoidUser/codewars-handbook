# [Did she say hallo?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/did-she-say-hallo "https://www.codewars.com/kata/56a4addbfd4a55694100001f")

You received a whatsup message from an unknown number. Could it be from that girl/boy with a foreign accent you met
yesterday evening?

Write a simple function to check if the string contains the word hallo in different languages.

These are the languages of the possible people you met the night before:

* hello - english
* ciao - italian
* salut - french
* hallo - german
* hola - spanish
* ahoj - czech republic
* czesc - polish

Notes

* you can assume the input is a string.
* to keep this a beginner exercise you don't need to check if the greeting is a subset of word (`Hallowen` can pass the
  test)
* function should be case-insensitive to pass the tests
