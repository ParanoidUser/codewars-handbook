# [Email Address Obfuscator](https://www.codewars.com/kata/email-address-obfuscator "https://www.codewars.com/kata/562d8d4c434582007300004e")

Many people choose to obfuscate their email address when displaying it on the Web. One common way of doing this is by substituting the `@` and `.` characters for their literal equivalents in brackets.

Example 1:
```
user_name@example.com
=> user_name [at] example [dot] com
```

Example 2:
```
af5134@borchmore.edu
=> af5134 [at] borchmore [dot] edu
```
Example 3:
```
jim.kuback@ennerman-hatano.com
=> jim [dot] kuback [at] ennerman-hatano [dot] com
```

Using the examples above as a guide, write a function that takes an email address string and returns the obfuscated version as a string that replaces the characters `@` and `.` with `[at]` and `[dot]`, respectively.

>Notes

>* Input (`email`) will always be a string object. Your function should return a string.

>* Change only the `@` and `.` characters.

>* Email addresses may contain more than one `.` character.

>* Note the additional whitespace around the bracketed literals in the examples!
