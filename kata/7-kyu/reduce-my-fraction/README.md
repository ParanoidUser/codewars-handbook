# [Reduce My Fraction](https://www.codewars.com/kata/reduce-my-fraction "https://www.codewars.com/kata/576400f2f716ca816d001614")

Write a function which reduces fractions to their simplest form! Fractions will be presented as an
array/tuple (depending on the language) of strictly positive integers, and the reduced fraction must
be returned as an array/tuple:

```
input:   [numerator, denominator]
output:  [reduced numerator, reduced denominator]
example: [45, 120] --> [3, 8]
```

All numerators and denominators will be positive integers.
