# [Remove the parentheses](https://www.codewars.com/kata/remove-the-parentheses "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5f7c38eb54307c002a2b8cc8")

In this kata you are given a string for example:

```
"example(unwanted thing)example"
```

Your task is to remove everything inside the parentheses as well as the parentheses themselves.

The example above would return:

```
"exampleexample"
```

## Notes

* Other than parentheses only letters and spaces can occur in the string. Don't worry about other brackets like ```"[]"``` and ```"{}"``` as these will never appear.
* There can be multiple parentheses.
* The parentheses can be nested.
