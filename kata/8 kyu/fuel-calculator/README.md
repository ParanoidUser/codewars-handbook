In this kata you will have to write a function that takes `litres` and `pricePerLiter` as arguments. Purchases of 2 or more litres get a discount of 5 cents per litre, purchases of 4 or more litres get a discount of 10 cents per litre, and so on every two litres, up to a maximum discount of 25 cents per litre. But total discount per liter cannot be more than 25 cents. round answer to 2 decimal places. Also you can guess that there will not be negative or non-numeric inputs.

Good Luck!
