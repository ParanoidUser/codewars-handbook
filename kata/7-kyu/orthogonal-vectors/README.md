# [Orthogonal Vectors](https://www.codewars.com/kata/orthogonal-vectors "https://www.codewars.com/kata/53670c5867e9f2222f000225")

Suppose I have two vectors: `(a1, a2, a3, ..., aN)` and `(b1, b2, b3, ..., bN)`. The dot product between these two vectors is defined as:

```
a1*b1 + a2*b2 + a3*b3 + ... + aN*bN
```

The vectors are classified as orthogonal if the dot product equals zero.


Complete the function that accepts two sequences as inputs and returns `true` if the vectors are orthogonal, and `false` if they are not. The sequences will always be correctly formatted and of the same length, so there is no need to check them first.


## Examples
```
[1, 1, 1], [2, 5, 7] --> false
[1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0] --> true
```
