# [Bus mastering - Who is the most prioritary?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/bus-mastering-who-is-the-most-prioritary "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a0366f12b651dbfa300000c")

When multiple master devices are connected to a single bus (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_bus), there needs to be an arbitration in order to choose which of them can have access to the bus (and 'talk' with a slave).

We implement here a very simple model of bus mastering. Given `n`, a number representing the number of **masters** connected to the bus, and a fixed priority order (the first master has more access priority than the second and so on...), the task is to choose the selected master.
In practice, you are given a string `input` of length `n` representing the `n` masters' requests to get access to the bus, and you should return a string representing the masters, showing which (only one) of them was granted access:

```
The string 1101 means that master 0, master 1 and master 3 have requested
access to the bus. 
Knowing that master 0 has the greatest priority, the output of the function should be: 1000
```

## Examples

```
* arbitrate("001000101", 9) -> "001000000" 

* arbitrate("000000101", 9) -> "000000100"

* `n` is not mandatory for solving the kata

```

## Notes

* The resulting string (`char* `) should be allocated in the `arbitrate` function, and will be free'ed in the tests.

* `n` is always greater or equal to 1.
