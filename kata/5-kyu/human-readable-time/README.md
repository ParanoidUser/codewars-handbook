# [Human Readable Time](https://www.codewars.com/kata/human-readable-time "https://www.codewars.com/kata/52685f7382004e774f0001f7")

Write a function, which takes a non-negative integer (seconds) as input and returns the time in a
human-readable format (`HH:MM:SS`)

* `HH` = hours, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 99
* `MM` = minutes, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
* `SS` = seconds, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59

The maximum time never exceeds 359999 (`99:59:59`)

You can find some examples in the test fixtures.
