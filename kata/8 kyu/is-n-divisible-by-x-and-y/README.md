# [Is n divisible by x and y?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/is-n-divisible-by-x-and-y "5545f109004975ea66000086")

Create a function `isDivisible(n, x, y)` that checks if a number `n` is divisible by two numbers `x` **AND** `y`. All inputs are positive, non-zero digits.

```
Example:
isDivisible(3,1,3)--> true because 3 is divisible by 1 and 3
isDivisible(12,2,6)--> true because 12 is divisible by 2 and 6
isDivisible(100,5,3)--> false because 100 is not divisible by 3
isDivisible(12,7,5)--> false because 12 is neither divisible by 7 nor 5
```
