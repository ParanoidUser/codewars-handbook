Your are given a string. You must replace the word(s) `coverage` by `covfefe`, however, if you don't find the word `coverage` in the string, you must add `covfefe` at the end of the string with a leading space.

For the languages where the string is not immutable (such as ruby), don't modify the given string, otherwise this will break the test cases.
