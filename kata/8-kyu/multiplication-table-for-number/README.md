# [Multiplication table for number](https://www.codewars.com/kata/multiplication-table-for-number "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a2fd38b55519ed98f0000ce")

Your goal is to return multiplication table for ```number``` that is always an integer from 1 to 10.

For example, a multiplication table (string) for ```number == 5``` looks like below:

```
1 * 5 = 5
2 * 5 = 10
3 * 5 = 15
4 * 5 = 20
5 * 5 = 25
6 * 5 = 30
7 * 5 = 35
8 * 5 = 40
9 * 5 = 45
10 * 5 = 50
```

```
P. S. You can use ```\n``` in string to jump to the next line.
```

Note: newlines should be added between 

rows, but there should be no trailing newline at the end.
