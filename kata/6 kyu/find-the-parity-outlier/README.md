# [Find The Parity Outlier](https://www.codewars.com/kata/find-the-parity-outlier "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5526fc09a1bbd946250002dc")

You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer `N`. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" `N`.

## Examples

```
[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]
Should return: 11 (the only odd number)

[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]
Should return: 160 (the only even number)
```
