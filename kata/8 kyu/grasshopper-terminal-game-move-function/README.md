## Terminal game move function

In this game, the hero moves from left to right. The player rolls the dice and moves the number of spaces indicated by the dice **two times**.

Create a function for the terminal game that takes the current position of the hero and the roll (1-6) and return the new position.

### Example:
```
move(3, 6) should equal 15
```
