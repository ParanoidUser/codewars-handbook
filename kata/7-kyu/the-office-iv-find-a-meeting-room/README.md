# [The Office IV - Find a Meeting Room](https://www.codewars.com/kata/the-office-iv-find-a-meeting-room "https://www.codewars.com/kata/57f604a21bd4fe771b00009c")

Your job at E-Corp is both boring and difficult. It isn't made any easier by the fact that everyone constantly wants to have a meeting with you, and that the meeting rooms are always taken!

In this kata, you will be given an array. Each value represents a meeting room. Your job? Find the **first** empty one and return its index (N.B. There may be more than one empty room in some test cases). 

'X' --> busy
'O' --> empty

If all rooms are busy, return 'None available!'.
