# [Upside down numbers](https://www.codewars.com/kata/upside-down-numbers "https://www.codewars.com/kata/59f7597716049833200001eb")

Consider the numbers `6969` and `9116`. When you rotate them `180 degrees` (upside down), these numbers remain the same. To clarify, if we write them down on a paper and turn the paper upside down, the numbers will be the same. Try it and see! Some numbers such as `2` or `5` don't yield numbers when rotated.

Given a range, return the count of upside down numbers within that range.  For example, `solve(0,10) = 3`, because there are only `3` upside down numbers `>= 0 and < 10`. They are `0, 1, 8`.
