# [Histogram - H1](https://www.codewars.com/kata/histogram-h1 "https://www.codewars.com/kata/57d532d2164a67cded0001c7")

<h2>Background</h2>

A 6-sided die is rolled a number of times and the results are plotted as a character-based histogram.

Example:

```
6|##### 5
5|
4|# 1
3|########## 10
2|### 3
1|####### 7
```

<h2>Task</h2>

You will be passed the dice value frequencies, and your task is to write the code to return a string representing a histogram, so that when it is printed it has the same format as the example.

<h2>Notes</h2>

* There are no trailing spaces on the lines
* All lines (including the last) end with a newline ```\n```
* A count is displayed beside each bar except where the count is 0
* The number of rolls may vary but there are never more than 100
