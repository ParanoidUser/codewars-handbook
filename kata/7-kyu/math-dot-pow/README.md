When I was a kid, there was a time when I thought that raising a to the bth power worked differently.
For example, to calculate 2^3, I'd think "Okay, `2^2=2*2=4`, so `2^3=4*4=16`"
If I was doing 3^4, I'd do:
`3*3=9`
`9*9=81`
`81*81=6561`

So, given two BigIntegers, raise a to the bth power the same way I used to. If the power is less than 1, return -1 as a BigInteger.
