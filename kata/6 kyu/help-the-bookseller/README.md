# [Help the bookseller!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/help-the-bookseller "https://www.codewars.com/kata/54dc6f5a224c26032800005c")

A bookseller has lots of books classified in 26 categories labeled A, B, ... Z. Each book has a code c of
  3, 4, 5 or more capitals letters. The 1st letter of a code is the capital letter of the book category.
  In the bookseller's stocklist each code c is followed by a space and by a positive integer n (int n >= 0) 
  which indicates the quantity of books of this code in stock.

For example an extract of one of the stocklists could be:
```
L = {"ABART 20", "CDXEF 50", "BKWRK 25", "BTSQZ 89", "DRTYM 60"}.
```
or
```
L = ["ABART 20", "CDXEF 50", "BKWRK 25", "BTSQZ 89", "DRTYM 60"] or ....
```

  You will be given a stocklist (e.g. : L) and a list of categories in capital letters 
  e.g : 
  ```
  M = {"A", "B", "C", "W"} 
  ```
  or
  ```
  M = ["A", "B", "C", "W"] or ...
  ```
  
  and your task is to find all the books of L with codes 
  belonging to each category of M and to sum their quantity according to each category. 


  For the lists L and M of example you have to return the string (in Haskell/Clojure/Racket a list of pairs):  
  ```
  (A : 20) - (B : 114) - (C : 50) - (W : 0)
  ```  

  where A, B, C, W are the categories, 20 is the sum of the unique book of category A, 114 the sum corresponding
  to "BKWRK" and "BTSQZ", 50 corresponding to "CDXEF" and 0 to category 'W' since there are no code beginning with W.

  If L or M are empty return string is `""` (Clojure and Racket should return an empty array/list instead).
  
## Note:
In the result codes and their values are in the same order as in M.
