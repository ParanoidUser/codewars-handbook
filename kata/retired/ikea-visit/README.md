One day you decide to go to IKEA to buy yourself a couple of tables for your new house, and you want to make sure you get enough screws to successfully assemble and put together all of your newly-bought tables. Let's also assume that for every table you buy, the next table will be bigger than the previous one, thus requiring one more screw. For example, table number 1 requires 1 screw, table number 2 requires 2 screws and so forth. 

Make a boolean method called checkEnoughScrews with an input of total screws and tables that returns True if there are enough screws to assemble the tables, or return False otherwise.
