It reduced the time for messages to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts to about 10 days, before it was made obsolete by the [transcontinental telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_transcontinental_telegraph).

## How it worked

There were a number of *stations*, where:

* The rider switched to a fresh horse and carried on, or
* The mail bag was handed over to the next rider

## Task

`stations` is a list/array of distances (miles) from one station to the next along the Pony Express route.

Implement the `riders` method/function, to return how many riders are necessary to get the mail from one end to the other.

**NOTE:** Each rider travels as far as he can, but never more than 100 miles.
