Given a number `n`, find the next number that has disjoint set of digits as `n` and is greater
than `n`. If n is the greatest possible number with its set of digits, then return `0`.

### Examples:

> input : 20 \
> output : 31

> input : 100 \
> output : 222

### Note:

The given number should be a positive int
