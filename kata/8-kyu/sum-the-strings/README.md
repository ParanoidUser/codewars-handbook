# [Sum The Strings](https://www.codewars.com/kata/sum-the-strings "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5966e33c4e686b508700002d")

Create a function that takes 2 integers in form of a string as an input, and outputs the sum (also as a string):

Example: (**Input1, Input2 -->Output**)

```
"4", "5" --> "9"
"34", "5" --> "39"
"", "" --> "0"
"2", "" --> "2"
"-5", "3" --> "-2"
```

Notes:
- If either input is an empty string, consider it as zero.

- Inputs and the expected output will never exceed the signed 32-bit integer limit (`2^31 - 1`)
