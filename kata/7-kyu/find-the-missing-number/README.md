The following was a question that I received during a technical interview for an entry level software developer position. I thought I'd post it here so that everyone could give it a go:

You are given an unsorted array containing all the integers from 0 to 100 inclusively. However, one number is missing. Write a function to find and return this number. What are the time and space complexities of your solution?
