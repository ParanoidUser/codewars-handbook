# [80's Kids #7: She's a Small Wonder](https://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-7-shes-a-small-wonder "https://www.codewars.com/kata/56743fd3a12043ffbb000049")

Vicky is quite the small wonder. Most people don't even realize she's not a real girl, but a robot living amongst us. Sure, if you stick around her home for a while you might see her creator open up her back and make a few tweaks and even see her recharge in the closet instead of sleeping in a bed.

In this kata, we're going to help Vicky keep track of the words she's learning.

Write a function, learnWord(word) which is a method of the Robot object. The function should report back whether the word is now stored, or if she already knew the word.

Example:
````
Robot vicky = new Robot();
vicky.learnWord("hello") -> "Thank you for teaching me hello"
vicky.learnWord("abc") -> "Thank you for teaching me abc"
vicky.learnWord("hello") -> "I already know the word hello"
vicky.learnWord("wow!") -> "I do not understand the input"
````

Case shouldn't matter. Only alpha characters are valid.
There's also a little trick here.
