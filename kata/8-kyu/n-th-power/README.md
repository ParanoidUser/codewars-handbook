# [N-th Power](https://www.codewars.com/kata/n-th-power "https://www.codewars.com/kata/57d814e4950d8489720008db")

You are given an array with positive numbers and a number N. You should find the N-th power of the element in the array with the index N. If N is outside of the array, then return -1. Don't forget that the first element has the index 0.

Let's look at a few examples:

* array = [1, 2, 3, 4] and N = 2, then the result is 3^2 == 9;
* array = [1, 2, 3] and N = 3, but N is outside of the array, so the result is -1.
