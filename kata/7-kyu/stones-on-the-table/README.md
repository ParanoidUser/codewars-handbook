# [Stones on the Table](https://www.codewars.com/kata/stones-on-the-table "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5f70e4cce10f9e0001c8995a")

There are some stones on Bob's table in a row, and each of them can be red, green or blue, indicated by the characters `R`, `G`, and `B`.

Help Bob find the minimum number of stones he needs to remove from the table so that the stones in each pair of adjacent stones have
different colors.

Examples:

```
"RGBRGBRGGB" => 1
"RGGRGBBRGRR" => 3
"RRRRGGGGBBBB" => 9
```
