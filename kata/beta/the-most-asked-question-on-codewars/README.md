What is the most asked question on CodeWars?

> [Can](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Acodewars.com+"can+someone+explain") [someone](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Acodewars.com+"can+you+explain") [explain](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Acodewars.com+"can+anyone+explain") `/*...*/`?

You need to write a function `detect` that will check if a string starts with `Can someone explain`, case-sensitive. Return `true` if so, `false` otherwise.

Let's hope you don't write a solution that makes people ask that question at you!
