# [Shift Left](https://www.codewars.com/kata/shift-left-1 "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5bdc191306a8a678f6000187")

You are given two strings. In a single move, you can choose any of them, and delete the first (i.e. leftmost) character.

For Example:

* By applying a move to the string `"where"`, the result is the string `"here"`.
* By applying a move to the string `"a"`, the result is an empty string `""`.

Implement a function that calculates the minimum number of moves that should be performed to make the given strings equal.

## Notes

* Both strings consist of lowercase latin letters.
* If the string is already empty, you cannot perform any more delete operations.
