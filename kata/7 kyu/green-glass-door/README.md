Step through my `green glass door`.

You can take the `moon`, but not the `sun`.

You can take your `slippers`, but not your `sandals`.

You can go through `yelling`, but not `shouting`.

You can't run through `fast`, but you can run with `speed`.

You can take a `sheet`, but not your `blanket`.

You can wear your `glasses`, but not your `contacts`.

Have you figured it out? Good! Then write a program that can figure it out as well.
