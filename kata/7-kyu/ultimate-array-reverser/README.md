# [Ultimate Array Reverser](https://www.codewars.com/kata/ultimate-array-reverser "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5c3433a4d828182e420f4197")

Given an array of strings, reverse them and their order in such way that their length stays the same as the length of the original inputs.

## Example:

```
Input:  {"I", "like", "big", "butts", "and", "I", "cannot", "lie!"}
Output: {"!", "eilt", "onn", "acIdn", "ast", "t", "ubgibe", "kilI"}
```
