All Star Code Challenge #18

Create a function called that accepts 2 string arguments and returns an integer of the count of occurrences the 2nd argument is found in the first one.

If no occurrences can be found, a count of 0 should be returned.

```
strCount("Hello", 'o') // => 1
strCount("Hello", 'l') // => 2
strCount("", 'z')      // => 0
```

Notes:
* The first argument can be an empty string  
* The second string argument will always be of length 1
