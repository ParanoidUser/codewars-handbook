For this kata, you are given three points ```(x1,y1,z1)```, ```(x2,y2,z2)```, and ```(x3,y3,z3)``` that lie on a straight line in 3-dimensional space.
You have to figure out which point lies in between the other two.

Your function should return 1, 2, or 3 to indicate which point is the in-between one.
