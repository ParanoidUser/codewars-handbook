[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) is an online educational platform for computer programming.
On the platform, users known as *code warriors* attempt to solve programming challenges, known as
*kata*, to practice programming skills and earn honor points. Each kata is assigned a *kyū* rank
based on its subject and difficulty. The more difficult the kata, the more points will be awarded.
All code warriors start at 8 kyū 👘 and advance through the ranks to the final 4th dan 🥋.
Warriors are not the ones who always win, but the ones that always fight. Banzai!

## Overview

The repository contains a collection of Java solutions to Codewars challenges, grouped by kyū rank.
Each kata is organized in a separate folder named by its slug and accompanied by a task description,
a solution source code, and verification tests. All solutions were solved
on [the official platform](https://www.codewars.com) and verified against the original test suite.

slug.
