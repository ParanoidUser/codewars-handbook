# [Invert values](https://www.codewars.com/kata/invert-values "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5899dc03bc95b1bf1b0000ad")

Given a set of numbers, return the additive inverse of each. Each positive becomes negatives, and the negatives become positives.

```
invert([1,2,3,4,5]) == [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]
invert([1,-2,3,-4,5]) == [-1,2,-3,4,-5]
invert([]) == []
```

```
You can assume that all values are integers. Do not mutate the input array/list.
