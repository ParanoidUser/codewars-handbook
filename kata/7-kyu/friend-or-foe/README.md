# [Friend or Foe?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/friend-or-foe "https://www.codewars.com/kata/55b42574ff091733d900002f")

Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.

If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...

```
Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"]
Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]

Input = ["Peter", "Stephen", "Joe"]
Output = []
```

Input strings will only contain letters.
Note: keep the original order of the names in the output.
