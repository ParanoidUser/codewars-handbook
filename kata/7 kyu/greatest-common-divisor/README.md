# [Greatest common divisor](https://www.codewars.com/kata/greatest-common-divisor "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5500d54c2ebe0a8e8a0003fd")

Find the greatest common divisor of two positive integers. The integers can be large, so you need to find a clever solution. 

The inputs `x` and `y` are always greater or equal to 1, so the the greatest common divisor will always be an integer that is also greater or equal to 1.
