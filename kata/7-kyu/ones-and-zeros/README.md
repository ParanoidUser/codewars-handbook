# [Ones and Zeros](https://www.codewars.com/kata/ones-and-zeros "https://www.codewars.com/kata/578553c3a1b8d5c40300037c")

Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.

Eg: `[0, 0, 0, 1]` is treated as `0001` which is the binary representation of `1`.

Examples:
```
Testing: [0, 0, 0, 1] ==> 1
Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
Testing: [0, 1, 0, 1] ==> 5
Testing: [1, 0, 0, 1] ==> 9
Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
Testing: [0, 1, 1, 0] ==> 6
Testing: [1, 1, 1, 1] ==> 15
Testing: [1, 0, 1, 1] ==> 11
```

However, the arrays can have varying lengths, not just limited to `4`.
