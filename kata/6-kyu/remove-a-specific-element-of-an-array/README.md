# [Remove a Specific Element of an Array](https://www.codewars.com/kata/remove-a-specific-element-of-an-array "https://www.codewars.com/kata/581bb3c1c221fb8e790001ef")

You will be given a certain array of length ```n```, such that ```n > 4```, having positive and negative integers but there will be no zeroes and all the elements will occur once in it.

We may obtain an amount of ```n``` sub-arrays of length ```n - 1```, removing one element at a time (from left to right). 

For each subarray, let's calculate the product and sum of its elements with the corresponding absolute value of the quotient, ```q = SubProduct/SubSum``` (if it is possible, SubSum cannot be 0). 
Then we select the array with the lowest value of ```|q|```(absolute value)

e.g.: we have the array, ```arr = [1, 23, 2, -8, 5]```
```
Sub Arrays            SubSum    SubProduct         |q|
[23, 2, -8, 5]         22         -1840         83.636363
[1, 2, -8, 5]           0           -80          No value
[1, 23, -8, 5]         21          -920         43.809524
[1, 23, 2, 5]          31           230          7.419355  <--- selected array
[1, 23, 2, -8]         18           368         20.444444
```
Let's compare the given array with the selected subarray:
```
[1, 23, 2, -8, 5]
[1, 23, 2,     5]
```
The difference between them is at the index ```3``` for the given array, with element ```-8```, so we put both things for a result ```[3, -8]```.

That means that to obtain the selected subarray we have to take out the value -8 at index 3.
We need a function that receives an array as an argument and outputs the pair ```[index, arr[index]]``` that generates the subarray with  the lowest value of ```|q|```.

``` 
select_subarray([1, 23, 2, -8, 5]) == [3, -8]
```
Another case:
``` 
select_subarray([1, 3, 23, 4, 2, -8, 5, 18]) == [2, 23]
```
In Javascript the function will be ```selectSubarray()```.

We may have some special arrays that may have more than one solution as the one that follows below.
``` 
select_subarray([10, 20, -30, 100, 200]) == [[3, 100], [4, 200]]
```
If there is more than one result the function should output a 2Darray sorted by the index of the element removed from the array.

Thanks to Unnamed for detecting the special cases when we have multiple solutions.

Features of the random tests:
```
Number of tests = 200
length of the array, l, such that 20 <= l <= 100
```
