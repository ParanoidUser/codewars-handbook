# [Name That Number!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/name-that-number "https://www.codewars.com/kata/579ba41ce298a73aaa000255")

In this kata, you'll be given an integer of range `0 <= x <= 99` and have to return that number spelt out in English. A few examples:

```
nameThatNumber(4)  // returns "four"
nameThatNumber(19) // returns "nineteen"
nameThatNumber(99) // returns "ninety nine"
```

Words should be separated by only spaces and not hyphens. No need to validate parameters, they will always be in the range [0, 99]. Make sure the returned String has no leading of trailing spaces.
