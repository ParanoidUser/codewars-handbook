Vasya isn't really good at math. However, he wants to get a good mark for the class. So he made a deal with his teacher. "I wil study very hard and will be able to solve any given problem!" - Vasya said.

Finally, today is the time to show what Vasya achieved. He solved the given task immediately. Can you?

### Task:

You are given a system of equations:

In JS, C# and Java the parameters of the system: `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000`  

You should count, how many there are pairs of integers (a, b) (0 ≤ a, b) which satisfy the system.

### Examples

```
SystemOfEq.Solution(9,3) // => 1 
SystemOfEq.Solution(14,28) // => 1
SystemOfEq.Solution(4,20) // => 0
```
