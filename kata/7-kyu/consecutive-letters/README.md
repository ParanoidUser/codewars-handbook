# [Consecutive letters](https://www.codewars.com/kata/consecutive-letters "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5ce6728c939bf80029988b57")

In this Kata, we will check if a string contains consecutive letters as they appear in the English alphabet and if each letter occurs only once. 

## Example 

```
solve("abc") = True, because it contains a,b,c
solve("abd") = False, because a, b, d are not consecutive, and c is missing.
solve("dabc") = True, because it contains a, b, c, d
solve("abbc") = False, because b does not occur once.
solve("v") = True
```

All inputs will be lowercase letters.
