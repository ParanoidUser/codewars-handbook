# [Return 1, 2, 3 randomly](https://www.codewars.com/kata/return-1-2-3-randomly "https://www.codewars.com/kata/593e84f16e836ca9a9000054")

You have function `one_two` (`oneTwo` for Java) that returns 1 or 2 with 50% chance. `one_two` is already defined in a global scope and can be called everywhere.

Your goal is to create function `one_two_three` (`oneTwoThree` for Java) that returns 1, 2 or 3 with equal probability using only `one_two` function.

Do not try to cheat returning repeating non-random sequences. There is randomness test especially for this case.
