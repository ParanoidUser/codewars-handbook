# [Simple string division](https://www.codewars.com/kata/simple-string-division "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b83c1c44a6acac33400009a")

In this Kata, you will be given a number in form of a string and an integer `k` and your task is to insert `k` commas into the string and determine which of the partitions is the largest. 

```
For example:
solve('1234',1) = 234 because ('1','234') or ('12','34') or ('123','4').
solve('1234',2) = 34 because ('1','2','34') or ('1','23','4') or ('12','3','4'). 
solve('1234',3) = 4
solve('2020',1) = 202
```
