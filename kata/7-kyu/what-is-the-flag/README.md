# [What is the flag?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/what-is-the-flag "https://www.codewars.com/kata/61efc02e4fd88600343b5c58")

- The flag is hidden in the string variable `FLAG`
- The flag is in the format `FLAG{CAPITAL-LETTERS-WITH-HYPHEN}`
- The flag couldn't be found from the string literal right away... but *You can indeed **see** it
  somehow!*
- A magic number `16` might help... but how should it be used?
