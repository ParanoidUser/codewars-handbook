# [Convert string to camel case](https://www.codewars.com/kata/convert-string-to-camel-case "https://www.codewars.com/kata/517abf86da9663f1d2000003")

Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized **only** if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case). 

## Examples

```
toCamelCase("the-stealth-warrior") // returns "theStealthWarrior"

toCamelCase("The_Stealth_Warrior") // returns "TheStealthWarrior"
```
