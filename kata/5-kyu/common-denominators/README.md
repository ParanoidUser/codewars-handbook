Common denominators

 You will have a list of rationals in the form 
 ```
 { {numer_1, denom_1} , ... {numer_n, denom_n} } 
 ```
 or
 ```
 [ [numer_1, denom_1] , ... [numer_n, denom_n] ] 
 ``` 
 or
 ```
 [ (numer_1, denom_1) , ... (numer_n, denom_n) ] 
 ```
 
 
 where all numbers are positive ints.
 
 You have to produce a result in the form 
 ```
 (N_1, D) ... (N_n, D) 
 ```
 or
 ```
 [ [N_1, D] ... [N_n, D] ] 
 ```
or
 ```
 [ (N_1', D) , ... (N_n, D) ] 
 ```
or
```
{{N_1, D} ... {N_n, D}} 
```
or
```
"(N_1, D) ... (N_n, D)"
```

depending on the language (See Example tests)

 in which D is as small as possible
 and 
 
 ```
 N_1/D == numer_1/denom_1 ... N_n/D == numer_n,/denom_n.
 ```
 
Example: 
 
```
convertFracs [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)] `shouldBe` [(6, 12), (4, 12), (3, 12)]
```

# Note: 
Due to the fact that first translations were written long ago - more than 4 years - these translations have only irreducible fractions. Newer translations have some reducible fractions. To be on the safe side it is better to do a bit more work by simplifying fractions even if they don't have to be.

# Note for Bash:
input is a string,  e.g `"2,4,2,6,2,8"`

output is  then         `"6 12 4 12 3 12"`
