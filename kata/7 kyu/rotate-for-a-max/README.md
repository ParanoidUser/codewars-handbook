# [Rotate for a Max](https://www.codewars.com/kata/rotate-for-a-max "https://www.codewars.com/kata/56a4872cbb65f3a610000026")

Let us begin with an example:

Take a number: `56789`. Rotate left, you get `67895`. 

Keep the first digit in place and rotate left the other digits: `68957`. 

Keep the first two digits in place and rotate the other ones: `68579`. 

Keep the first three digits and rotate left the rest:
`68597`. 
Now it is over since keeping the first four it remains only one digit which
rotated is itself.

You have the following sequence of numbers:

`56789 -> 67895 -> 68957 -> 68579 -> 68597`

and you must return the greatest: `68957`.

# Task

Write `function max_rot(n)` which given a positive integer `n` returns the maximum number you got doing rotations similar to the above example.

So `max_rot` (or `maxRot` or ... depending on the language) is such as:

- `max_rot(56789) should return 68957`

- `max_rot(38458215) should return 85821534`
