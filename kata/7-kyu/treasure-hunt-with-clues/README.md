# [Treasure Hunt with Clues](https://www.codewars.com/kata/treasure-hunt-with-clues "https://www.codewars.com/kata/66c0fec80a2a28b2a451d408")

Inputs:

A `n Ã— n` grid with `1 >= n >= 9`, and 2 integers `row, col` with `1 <= row, col <= n`, indicating the starting position of the treasure
hunt.

Clues:

Every cell of the grid contains a number between `11` and <code>n<sup>2</sup></code>. These values provide the coordinates of the
next cell to search. The treasure is found in a cell whose value matches its location. (The clue says "stay where you are"!) There will
always be treasure reachable from the starting position.

Output:

The value in the treasure cell reached by following the clues from the starting position.

Example:

Consider the grid below, with starting position <code>row=3,col=4.</code>

```
34 21 32 44 25
21 41 43 14 31
31 45 52 42 23
33 15 51 44 35
21 52 33 13 44
```

Indexes start from 1, so the value in cell <code>3,4</code> is <code>42.</code> Thus the next clue is found in cell <code>4,2.</code> The
value there is <code>15.</code> Seeking in cell <code>1,5</code> uncovers the clue <code>25,</code> and cell <code>2,5</code>
contains <code>31.</code> Since the value in cell <code>3,1</code> is <code>31,</code> that is the location of the treasure.
