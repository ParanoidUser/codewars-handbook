# [Hello World - Without Strings](https://www.codewars.com/kata/hello-world-without-strings "https://www.codewars.com/kata/584c7b1e2cb5e1a727000047")

You need to create a function, `helloWorld`, that will return the String `Hello, World!` without actually using raw
strings. This includes quotes, double quotes and template strings. You can, however, use the `String` constructor and
any related functions.

You cannot use the following:

 ```
"Hello, World!"
'Hello, World!'
`Hello, World!`
 ```
