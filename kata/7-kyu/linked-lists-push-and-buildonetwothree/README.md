Linked Lists - Push & BuildOneTwoThree

Write push() and buildOneTwoThree() functions to easily update and initialize linked lists. Try to use the push() function within your buildOneTwoThree() function.

Here's an example of push() usage:
```
var chained = null
chained = push(chained, 3)
chained = push(chained, 2)
chained = push(chained, 1)
push(chained, 8) === 8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null
```

The push function accepts head and data parameters, where head is either a node object or null/None/nil. Your push implementation should be able to create a new linked list/node when head is null/None/nil.

The buildOneTwoThree function should create and return a linked list with three nodes: ```1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null```
