# [Bingo (Or Not)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/bingo-or-not "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a1ee4dfffe75f0fcb000145")

For this game of `BINGO`, you will receive a single array of 10 numbers from 1 to 26 as an input. Duplicate numbers within the array are possible.

Each number corresponds to their alphabetical order letter (e.g. 1 = A. 2 = B, etc). Write a function where you will win the game if your numbers can spell `"BINGO"`. They do not need to be in the right order in the input array). Otherwise you will lose. Your outputs should be `"WIN"` or `"LOSE"` respectively.
