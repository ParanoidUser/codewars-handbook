# [Keep up the hoop](https://www.codewars.com/kata/keep-up-the-hoop "https://www.codewars.com/kata/55cb632c1a5d7b3ad0000145")

Alex just got a new hula hoop, he loves it but feels discouraged because his little brother is better than him

Write a program where Alex can input (n) how many times the hoop goes round and it will return him an encouraging message :) 

 - If Alex gets 10 or more hoops, return the string "Great, now move on to tricks".
 - If he doesn't get 10 hoops, return the string "Keep at it until you get it".
