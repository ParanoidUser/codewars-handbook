# Sort an array by value and index

Your task is to sort an array of integer numbers by the product of the value and the index of the positions.
<br><br>
For sorting the index starts at 1, NOT at 0!<br>
The sorting has to be ascending.<br>
The array will never be null and will always contain numbers.
<br><br>
Example:
```
Input: 23, 2, 3, 4, 5
Product of value and index:
23 => 23 LICENSE build.gradle.kts docs gradle gradle.properties gradlew gradlew.bat kata settings.gradle.kts 1 = 23 -> Output-Pos 4
 2 => 2 LICENSE build.gradle.kts docs gradle gradle.properties gradlew gradlew.bat kata settings.gradle.kts 2 = 4 -> Output-Pos 1
 3 => 3 LICENSE build.gradle.kts docs gradle gradle.properties gradlew gradlew.bat kata settings.gradle.kts 3 = 9 -> Output-Pos 2
 4 => 4 LICENSE build.gradle.kts docs gradle gradle.properties gradlew gradlew.bat kata settings.gradle.kts 4 = 16 -> Output-Pos 3
 5 => 5 LICENSE build.gradle.kts docs gradle gradle.properties gradlew gradlew.bat kata settings.gradle.kts 5 = 25 -> Output-Pos 5

Output: 2, 3, 4, 23, 5
```
