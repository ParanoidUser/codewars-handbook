# [Reverse a Number](https://www.codewars.com/kata/reverse-a-number "https://www.codewars.com/kata/555bfd6f9f9f52680f0000c5")

Given a number, write a function to output its reverse digits.  (e.g. given 123 the answer is 321)

Numbers should preserve their sign; i.e. a negative number should still be negative when reversed.

## Examples

```
 123 ->  321
-456 -> -654
1000 ->    1
```
