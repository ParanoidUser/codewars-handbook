# [Convert a Boolean to a String](https://www.codewars.com/kata/convert-a-boolean-to-a-string "https://www.codewars.com/kata/551b4501ac0447318f0009cd")

In this programming exercise, you're going to learn about functions, boolean (true/false) values, strings, and the if-statement.

A **function** is a block of code that takes an _input_ and produces an _output_. In this example, `boolean_to_string` is a function whose _input_ is either _true_ or _false_, and whose _output_ is the string representation of the input, either _"true"_/_"True"_ or _"false"_/_"False"_ (check the sample tests about what capitalization to use in a given language).

A common idea we often want to represent in code is the concept of _true_ and _false_. A variable that can either be _true_ or _false_ is called a **boolean** variable. In this example, the input to `boolean_to_string` (represented by the variable `b`) is a _boolean_.

Lastly, when we want to take one action if a _boolean_ is _true_, and another if it is _false_, we use an **if-statement**.

For this kata, don't worry about **edge cases** like where unexpected input is passed to the function. You'll get to worry about these enough in later exercises.
