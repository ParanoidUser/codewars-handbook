In mathematics, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_%28mathematics%29">matrix</a> (
plural matrices) is a rectangular array of numbers. Matrices have many applications in programming,
from <a href="https://www.mathplanet.com/education/geometry/transformations/transformation-using-matrices">
performing transformations in 2D space</a>
to <a href="https://videolectures.net/icml09_dhillon_itmcml/">machine learning</a>.

One of the most useful operations to perform on matrices
is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication">matrix multiplication</a>, which
takes a pair of matrices and produces another matrix â€“ known as the dot product. Multiplying
matrices is very different to multiplying real numbers, and follows its own set of rules.

Unlike multiplying real numbers, multiplying matrices is <b>non-commutative</b>: in other words,
multiplying matrix ```a``` by matrix ```b``` will not give the same result as multiplying
matrix ```b``` by matrix ```a```.

Additionally, not all pairs of matrix can be multiplied. For two matrices to be multipliable, the
number of columns in matrix ```a``` must match the number of rows in matrix ```b```.

There are many introductions to matrix multiplication online, including
at <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/precalc-matrices/multiplying-matrices-by-matrices/v/matrix-multiplication-intro">
Khan Academy</a>, and in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfN1lqArwAg">classic MIT
lecture series by Herbert Gross</a>.

To complete this kata, write a function that takes two matrices - ```a``` and ```b``` - and returns
the dot product of those matrices. If the matrices cannot be multiplied,
return `null`/`None`/`Nothing` or similar.

Each matrix will be represented by a two-dimensional list (a list of lists). Each inner list will
contain one or more numbers, representing a row in the matrix.

For example, the following matrix:

```|1 2|```<br>```|3 4|```

Would be represented as:

```[[1, 2], [3, 4]]```

It can be assumed that all lists will be valid matrices, composed of lists with equal numbers of
elements, and which contain only numbers. The numbers may include integers and/or decimal points.
