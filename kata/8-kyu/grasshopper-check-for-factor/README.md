# Check for Factor

This function should test if the `factor` is a factor of `base`.

Return `true` if it is a factor or `false` if it is not.

## Information
Factors are numbers you can multiply together to get another number.

2 and 3 are factors of 6 because:
```
2 * 3 = 6
```


- You can find a factor by dividing numbers. If the remainder is 0 then the number is a factor.
- In Javascript and C# you can use `%` to check for a remainder

For example 2 is not a factor of 7 because:
```
7 % 2 = 1
```
