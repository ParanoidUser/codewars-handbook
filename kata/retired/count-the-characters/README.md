# [Count the Characters](https://www.codewars.com/kata/count-the-characters "https://www.codewars.com/kata/577ad961ae2807182f000c29")

The goal of this kata is to write a function that takes two inputs: a string and a character. The function will count the number of times that character appears in the string. The count is case insensitive.

For example: 

```
countChar("fizzbuzz","z") => 4
countChar("Fancy fifth fly aloof","f") => 5
```

The character can be any alphanumeric character.
