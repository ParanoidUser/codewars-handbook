# [Count characters in your string](https://www.codewars.com/kata/count-characters-in-your-string "https://www.codewars.com/kata/52efefcbcdf57161d4000091")

The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a string like `aba`, then the result
should be `{'a': 2, 'b': 1}`.

What if the string is empty? Then the result should be empty object literal, `{}`.
