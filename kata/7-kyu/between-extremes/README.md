Given an array of numbers, return the difference between the largest and smallest values. 

For example:

`[23, 3, 19, 21, 16]` should return `20` (i.e., `23 - 3`).

`[1, 434, 555, 34, 112]` should return `554` (i.e., `555 - 1`).

The array will contain a minimun of two elements. Input data range guarantees that `max-min` will cause no integer overflow.
