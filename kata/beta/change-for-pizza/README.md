# [Change for pizza](https://www.codewars.com/kata/change-for-pizza "https://www.codewars.com/kata/55e56e5b2f71cee88f00004f")

My friend Sergio visits a pizzeria every Tuesday and buys a pizza. Sergio always gives a 200 hryvnias banknote, but the pizza's price is always less than 200 hryvnias.

The prices sometimes changes and the pizzeria needs a special program to calculate the amount of money they need to return. The pizzeria's owner studied qbasic in college, so he wrote javascript as qbasic. Please, help him and fix a function that calculates the change for pizza.
