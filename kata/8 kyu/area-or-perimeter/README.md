# [Area or Perimeter](https://www.codewars.com/kata/area-or-perimeter "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5ab6538b379d20ad880000ab")

You are given the `length` and `width` of a 4-sided polygon. The polygon can either be a rectangle or a square.

If it is a square, return its area. If it is a rectangle, return its perimeter.

```
area_or_perimeter(6, 10) --> 32
```

> Note: for the purposes of this kata you will assume that it is a square if its `length` and `width` are equal, otherwise it is a rectangle.
