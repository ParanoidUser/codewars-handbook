# [Remove duplicates from list](https://www.codewars.com/kata/remove-duplicates-from-list "https://www.codewars.com/kata/57a5b0dfcf1fa526bb000118")

Define a function that removes duplicates from an array of non-negative numbers and returns it as a result.

The order of the sequence has to stay the same.

Examples:

```
Input -> Output
[1, 1, 2] -> [1, 2]
[1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2] -> [1, 2, 3]
```
