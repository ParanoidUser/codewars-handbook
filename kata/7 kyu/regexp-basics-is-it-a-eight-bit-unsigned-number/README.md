# [Regexp Basics - is it a eight bit unsigned number?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/regexp-basics-is-it-a-eight-bit-unsigned-number "https://www.codewars.com/kata/567e8f7b4096f2b4b1000005")

Implement `String#eight_bit_number?`, which should return true if given object is a number representable by 8 bit unsigned integer (0-255), `false` otherwise.

It should only accept numbers in canonical representation, so no leading `+`, extra `0`s, spaces etc.
