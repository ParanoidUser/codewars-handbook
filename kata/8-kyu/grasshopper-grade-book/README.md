Complete the function so that it finds the mean of the three scores passed to it and returns the letter value associated with that grade.

| Numerical Score    | Letter Grade |
|--------------------|--------------|
| 90 <= score <= 100 | 'A'          |
| 80 <= score < 90   | 'B'          |
| 70 <= score < 80   | 'C'          |
| 60 <= score < 70   | 'D'          |
| 0 <= score < 60    | 'F'          |

Tested values are all between 0 and 100. There's is no need to check for negative values or values greater than 100.
