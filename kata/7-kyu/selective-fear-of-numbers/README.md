# [Selective fear of numbers](https://www.codewars.com/kata/selective-fear-of-numbers "https://www.codewars.com/kata/55b1fd84a24ad00b32000075")

I've got a crazy mental illness.
I dislike numbers a lot. But it's a little complicated:
The number I'm afraid of depends on which day of the week it is...
This is a concrete description of my mental illness:

Monday     --> 12

Tuesday    --> numbers greater than 95

Wednesday  --> 34

Thursday   --> 0

Friday     --> numbers divisible by 2

Saturday   --> 56

Sunday     --> 666 or -666


Write a function which takes a string (day of the week) and an integer (number to be tested) so it tells the doctor if I'm afraid or not. (return a boolean)
