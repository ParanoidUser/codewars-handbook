You are the greatest chef on earth. No one boils eggs like you! Your restaurant is always full of guests, who love your boiled eggs. But
when there is a greater order of boiled eggs, you need some time, because you have only one pot for your job. How much time do you need?

## Your Task

Implement a function, which takes a non-negative integer, representing the number of eggs to boil. It must return the time in minutes (
integer), which it takes to have all the eggs boiled.

## Rules

* you can put at most 8 eggs into the pot at once
* it takes 5 minutes to boil an egg
* we assume, that the water is boiling all the time (no time to heat up)
* for simplicity, we also don't consider the time it takes to put eggs into the pot or get them out of it

## Example (Input --> Output)

```
0 --> 0
5 --> 5
10 --> 10
```
