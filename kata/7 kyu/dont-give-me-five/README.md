# [Don't give me five!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/dont-give-me-five "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5813d19765d81c592200001a")

In this kata you get the start number and the end number of a region and should return the count of all numbers except numbers with a 5 in it. The start and the end number are both inclusive!

Examples:

```
1,9 -> 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 -> Result 8
4,17 -> 4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,17 -> Result 12
```

The result may contain fives. ;-)<br>
The start number will always be smaller than the end number. Both numbers can be also negative!
