# Be Concise I - The Ternary Operator

You are given a function ```describeAge``` / ```describe_age``` that takes a parameter ```age``` (which will always be a **positive integer**) and does the following:

1. If the age is ```12``` or lower, it ```return "You're a(n) kid"```
2. If the age is anything between ```13``` and ```17``` (inclusive), it ```return "You're a(n) teenager"```
3. If the age is anything between ```18``` and ```64``` (inclusive), it ```return "You're a(n) adult"```
4. If the age is ```65``` or above, it ```return "You're a(n) elderly"```

Your task is to shorten the code as much as possible. Note that submitting the given code will not work because there is a character limit of **137**.

I'll give you a few hints:

1. The title itself is a hint - if you're not sure what to do, **always** research any terminology in this description that you have not heard of!
2. Don't you think the whole ```"You're a(n) <insert_something_here>"``` is very repetitive? ;)  Perhaps we can shorten it?
3. Write everything in one line, `\n` and other whitespaces counts.

**Whatever you do, do not change what the function does.**  Good luck :)
