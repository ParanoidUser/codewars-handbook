# [Remove the time](https://www.codewars.com/kata/remove-the-time "https://www.codewars.com/kata/56b0ff16d4aa33e5bb00008e")

You're re-designing a blog, and the blog's posts have the `Weekday Month Day, time` format for showing the date and time
when a post was made, e.g., `Friday May 2, 7pm`.

You're running out of screen real estate, and on some pages you want to display a shorter format, `Weekday Month Day`
that omits the time.

Write a function that takes the website date/time in its original string format and returns the shortened format.

## Input

Input will always be a string, e.g., `"Friday May 2, 7pm"`.

## Output

Output will be the shortened string, e.g., `"Friday May 2"`.
