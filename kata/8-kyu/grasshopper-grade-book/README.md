## Grade book

Complete the function so that it finds the mean of the three scores passed to it and returns the letter value associated with that grade.

Numerical Score    | Letter Grade
---                | ---
90 <= score <= 100 | 'A'
80 <= score < 90   | 'B'
70 <= score < 80   | 'C'
60 <= score < 70   | 'D'
 0 <= score < 60   | 'F'

Tested values are all between 0 and 100. There's is no need to check for negative values or values greater than 100.
