In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example:
5! = 5 \* 4 \* 3 \* 2 \* 1 = 120. By convention the value of 0! is 1.

Write a function to calculate factorial for a given input. If input is below 0 or above 12 throw an exception of type `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` (C#) or `IllegalArgumentException` (Java) or `RangeException` (PHP) or throw a `RangeError` (JavaScript) or `ValueError` (Python) or return `-1` (C).
