# [Regexp Basics - is it a six bit unsigned number?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/regexp-basics-is-it-a-six-bit-unsigned-number "https://www.codewars.com/kata/567e8dbb9b6f4da558000030")

Implement `String#six_bit_number?`, which should return true if given object is a number representable by 6 bit unsigned integer (0-63), `false` otherwise.

It should only accept numbers in canonical representation, so no leading `+`, extra `0`s, spaces etc.
