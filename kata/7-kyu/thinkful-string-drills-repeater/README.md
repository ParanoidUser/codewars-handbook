# [Thinkful - String Drills: Repeater](https://www.codewars.com/kata/thinkful-string-drills-repeater "https://www.codewars.com/kata/585a1a227cb58d8d740001c3")

Write a function named `repeater()` that takes two arguments (a string and a number), and returns a new string where the input string is repeated that many times.

## Example:

```
Repeater.repeat("a", 5)
```

should return
```
"aaaaa"
```
