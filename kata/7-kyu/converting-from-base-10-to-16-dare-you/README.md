# [Converting from base 10 to 16! Dare you?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/converting-from-base-10-to-16-dare-you "https://www.codewars.com/kata/581ce19436049bc8610001f4")

Your task is very easy!!! The target is practising conversion "by hand" from base 10 to 16.

Develop a method ```public String convertToHex(int number)``` which allows converting ```number``` to Hexadecimal. Note that ```0<number<=4294967295```. The final result must concat at the start ```0x```. Letters must be in upperCase since the tests are expecting upperCases.

In this kata you have to programme "by hand" the conversion. What make sense is making your own method!!

These solutions are not the target of this kata.

```Integer.toString(a, 16)```
```String.format("0x%X", a)```
```Integer.toHexString(a)``

and same structures
