Java 8 has introduced a sexy new Stream API which makes it possible to solve some data related problems in just a few lines of code. Let's try it out!

You have a Student class (see the class declaration below).

You have an array of students and you want to get some aggregate data.

THE TASK: get the number of students by a gender for each department.
(i.e. "CS" department has 2 males, 3 females, "Economics" department has 4 males, 5 females, etc.)

Implement the method using Java 8 Stream API.
