# [Reverse the bits in an integer](https://www.codewars.com/kata/reverse-the-bits-in-an-integer "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5959ec605595565f5c00002b")

Write a function that reverses the bits in an integer.

For example, the number `417` is `110100001` in binary. Reversing the binary is `100001011` which is `267`.

You can assume that the number is not negative.
