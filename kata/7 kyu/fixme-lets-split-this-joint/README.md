# [FIXME: Let's split this joint ](https://www.codewars.com/kata/fixme-lets-split-this-joint "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a53f300d8e145df7f000497")

The code provided is supposed return an array of items that were separated in the `joint` string by `.`

But it's not working properly.

# Notes

* A zero length input `joint` string should yield an empty output array
* Empty items are preserved

# Task

Fix the bug so we can all go home early.
