# Background

I have stacked some cannon balls in a triangle-based pyramid.

Like this,

# Kata Task

Given the number of `layers` of my stack, what is the total height?

Return the height as multiple of the ball diameter.

## Example
The image above shows a stack of 3 layers.

## Notes
* `layers` >= 0
* approximate answers (within 0.001) are good enough
