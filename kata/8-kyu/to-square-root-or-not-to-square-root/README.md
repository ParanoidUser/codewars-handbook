Write a method, that will get an integer array as parameter and will process every number from this array.<br>
Return a new array with processing every number of the input-array like this:<br>
```
If the number has an integer square root, take this, otherwise square the number.

[4,3,9,7,2,1] -> [2,9,3,49,4,1]
```

The input array will always contain only positive numbers and will never be empty or null.

The input array should not be modified!
