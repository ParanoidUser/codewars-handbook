# [Ordered Count of Characters](https://www.codewars.com/kata/ordered-count-of-characters "https://www.codewars.com/kata/57a6633153ba33189e000074")

Count the number of occurrences of each character and return it as a (list of tuples) in order of
appearance. For empty output return (an empty list).

Consult the solution set-up for the exact data structure implementation depending on your language.

Example:

```
orderedCount("abracadabra") == [['a', 5], ['b', 2], ['r', 2], ['c', 1], ['d', 1]]
```
