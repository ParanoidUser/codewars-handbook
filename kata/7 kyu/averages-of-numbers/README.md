# [Averages of numbers](https://www.codewars.com/kata/averages-of-numbers "https://www.codewars.com/kata/57d2807295497e652b000139")

Write a method, that gets an array of integer-numbers and return an array of the averages of each integer-number and his follower, if there is one.

Example:
```
Input:  [ 1, 3, 5, 1, -10]
Output:  [ 2, 4, 3, -4.5]
```
If the array has 0 or 1 values or is null or None, your method should return an empty array.

Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)
