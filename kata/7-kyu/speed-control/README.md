In John's car the GPS records every `s` seconds the distance travelled from an origin (distances are measured in an arbitrary but consistent unit).
For example, below is part of a record with `s = 15`:

    x = [0.0, 0.19, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0, 2.25]
The sections are:

    0.0-0.19, 0.19-0.5, 0.5-0.75, 0.75-1.0, 1.0-1.25, 1.25-1.50, 1.5-1.75, 1.75-2.0, 2.0-2.25
  
We can calculate John's average hourly speed on every section and we get:

    [45.6, 74.4, 60.0, 60.0, 60.0, 60.0, 60.0, 60.0, 60.0]
Given `s` and `x` the task is to return as an integer the `*floor*` of the maximum average speed per hour obtained on the sections of `x`. 
If x length is less than or equal to 1 return `0` since the car didn't move.

# Example:
with the above data your function `gps(s, x)`should return `74`

# Note
With floats it can happen that results depends on the operations order. To calculate hourly speed you can use: 

` (3600 * delta_distance) / s`.
