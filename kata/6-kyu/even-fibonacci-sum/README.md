# [Even Fibonacci Sum](https://www.codewars.com/kata/even-fibonacci-sum "https://www.codewars.com/kata/55688b4e725f41d1e9000065")

Give the summation of all even numbers in a Fibonacci sequence up to, but not including, the number
passed to your function. Or, in other words, sum all the even Fibonacci numbers that are lower than
the given number n (n is not the nth element of Fibonacci sequence) without including n.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where the next value is the addition of the previous
two values. The series starts with 0 and 1:

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21...

For example:

```
  fibonacci(0)==0
  fibonacci(33)==10
  fibonacci(25997544)==19544084
```
