# [Binary scORe](https://www.codewars.com/kata/binary-score "https://www.codewars.com/kata/56cafdabc8cfcc3ad4000a2b")

Given a number `n` we will define its scORe to be `0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | ... | n`, where `|` is the [bitwise OR operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR).

Write a function that takes `n` and finds it's scORe.

| n       | scORe n |
|---------|---------|
| 0       | 0       |
| 1       | 1       |
| 49      | 63      |
| 1000000 | 1048575 |
