# [More than Zero?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/more-than-zero "https://www.codewars.com/kata/55a710b462afc49a540000b9")

Correct this code so that it takes one argument, `x`, and returns "`x` is more than zero" if `x` is positive (and nonzero), and otherwise,
returns "`x` is equal to or less than zero." In both cases, replace `x` with the actual value of `x`.
