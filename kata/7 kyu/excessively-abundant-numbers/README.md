# [Excessively Abundant Numbers](https://www.codewars.com/kata/excessively-abundant-numbers "https://www.codewars.com/kata/56a75b91688b49ad94000015")

An abundant number or excessive number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself. 

The integer 12 is the first abundant number. Its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 for a total of 16 (> 12).

Derive function `abundantNumber(num)/abundant_number(num)` which returns `true/True/.true.` if `num` is abundant, `false/False/.false.` if not.
