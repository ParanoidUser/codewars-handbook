# [Sum of numbers](https://www.codewars.com/kata/sum-of-numbers "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b2ada0e42b27ee1be00005c")

(This is my first program...)


Given a number A and a number B (both should be positive), find the number of ways that B numbers can be summed to A (Order MATTERS).

p.s. (You are going to need to change the FindWays in the description to Find_ways)

E.x. ```find_ways(5,3)``` => ```21```

The top example would be because (Order Matters):

0+0+5 = 5

0+1+4 = 5

0+2+3 = 5

0+3+2 = 5

0+4+1 = 5

0+5+0 = 5

1+0+4 = 5

1+1+3 = 5

1+2+2 = 5

1+3+1 = 5

....

or ```find_ways(19,6)```=> ```42504```


(P.s. There may or may not be an equation... You don't have to find all of them)
