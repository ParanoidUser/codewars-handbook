# [Robinson Crusoe](https://www.codewars.com/kata/robinson-crusoe "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5d95b7644a336600271f52ba")

Robinson Crusoe decides to explore his isle. On a sheet of paper he plans the following process.

His hut has coordinates `origin = [0, 0]`. From that origin he walks a given distance `d` on a line
that has a given angle `ang` with the x-axis. He gets to a point A.
(Angles are measured with respect to the x-axis) 

From that point A he walks the distance `d` multiplied by a constant `distmult` on a line that 
has the angle `ang` multiplied by a constant `angmult` and so on and on.

We have `d0 = d`, `ang0 = ang`; then `d1 = d * distmult`, `ang1 = ang * angmult` etc ...

Let us suppose he follows this process n times.
What are the coordinates `lastx, lasty` of the last point?

The function `crusoe` has parameters;
- n        : numbers of steps in the process
- d        : initial chosen distance
- ang      : initial chosen angle in degrees
- distmult : constant multiplier of the previous distance
- angmult  : constant multiplier of the previous angle

`crusoe(n, d, ang, distmult, angmult)` should return
`lastx, lasty` as an array or a tuple depending on the language.

## Example:

`crusoe(5, 0.2, 30, 1.02, 1.1)` ->

The successive `x` are : `0.0, 0.173205, 0.344294, 0.511991, 0.674744, 0.830674` (approximately)

The successive `y` are : `0.0, 0.1, 0.211106, 0.334292, 0.47052, 0.620695` (approximately)

and
```
lastx: 0.8306737544381833
lasty: 0.620694691344071
```
