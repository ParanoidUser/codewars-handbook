# [FIXME: 1, 2, 3, 4](https://www.codewars.com/kata/fixme-1-2-3-4 "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b13c699af73864aa7000031")

The code provided is supposed to simply return the named number as an integer.

But it's not working properly.

# Task

Fix the bug so we can all go home early.

# Notes

* Don't try to modify the `getNumber` API. It returns an enum.
