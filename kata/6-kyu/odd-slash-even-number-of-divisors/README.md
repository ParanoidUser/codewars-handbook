# [Odd/Even number of divisors](https://www.codewars.com/kata/odd-slash-even-number-of-divisors "https://www.codewars.com/kata/55830eec3e6b6c44ff000040")

Given an integer n return 'odd' if the number of its divisors is odd. 
Otherwise return 'even'.

## Example

All prime numbers have exactly two divisors (hence 'even')

For n=12 the divisors are [1,2,3,4,6,12] – 'even'

For n=4 the divisors are [1,2,4] – 'odd'
