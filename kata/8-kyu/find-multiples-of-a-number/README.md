# [Find Multiples of a Number](https://www.codewars.com/kata/find-multiples-of-a-number "https://www.codewars.com/kata/58ca658cc0d6401f2700045f")

In this simple exercise, you will build a program that takes a value, `integer`, and returns a list
of its multiples up to another value, `limit`. If `limit` is a multiple of `integer`, it should be
included as well. There will only ever be positive integers passed into the function, not consisting
of 0. The limit will always be higher than the base.

For example, if the parameters passed are `(2, 6)`, the function should return `[2, 4, 6]` as 2, 4,
and 6 are the multiples of 2 up to 6.
