# [Count by X](https://www.codewars.com/kata/count-by-x "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5513795bd3fafb56c200049e")

Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first `n` multiples of `x`.

Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater
than `0`.

Return the results as an array or list ( depending on language ).

### Examples

```
countBy(1,10)  // should return  {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
countBy(2,5)  // should return {2,4,6,8,10}
```
