# [Bits Battle](https://www.codewars.com/kata/bits-battle "https://www.codewars.com/kata/58856a06760b85c4e6000055")

The odd and even numbers are fighting against each other!

You are given a list of positive integers. The odd numbers from the list will fight using their `1` bits from their binary representation, while the even numbers will fight using their `0` bits. If present in the list, number `0` will be neutral, hence not fight for either side.

You should return:

* `odds win` if number of `1`s from odd numbers is larger than `0`s from even numbers
* `evens win` if number of `1`s from odd numbers is smaller than `0`s from even numbers
* `tie` if equal, including if list is empty

Please note that any prefix that might appear in the binary representation, e.g. `0b`, should not be counted towards the battle.

### Example:
For an input list of `[5, 3, 14]`:

* odds: `5` and `3` => `101` and `11` => four `1`s
* evens: `14` => `1110` => one `0`

Result: `odds win` the battle with 4-1
