# [Beginner Series #2 Clock][1]

Clock shows 'h' hours, 'm' minutes and 's' seconds after midnight.

Your task is to make 'Past' function which returns time converted to milliseconds.

##### Example:

```
Past(0, 1, 1) == 61000
```

Note! h, m and s will be only Natural numbers! 
Waiting for translations and Feedback! Thanks!
