# [Zig-Zag Camel](https://www.codewars.com/kata/zig-zag-camel "https://www.codewars.com/kata/582c6b7cfb3179eb6e000027")

A camel at the base of a large sand dune wants to get to the top of it to see what is on the other side.

The dune distance ```d``` and height ```h``` are as shown below:

Steep dunes don't worry him because this is a smart camel!

When the slope is > 30 degrees, then instead of going straight up he will zig-zag back and forth so the climb is not so steep.

## Task

Given ```d``` and ```h``` then what is the shortest amount of walking for our smart camel to get to the top of the sand dune?
