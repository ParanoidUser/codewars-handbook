How can you tell an extrovert from an
introvert at NSA? Va gur ryringbef,
gur rkgebireg ybbxf ng gur BGURE thl'f fubrf.

I found this joke on USENET, but the punchline is scrambled. Maybe you can decipher it?
According to Wikipedia, ROT13 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) is frequently used to obfuscate
jokes on USENET.

Hint: For this task you're only supposed to substitue characters. Not spaces, punctuation, numbers
etc.

Test examples:

```
"EBG13 rknzcyr." -->
"ROT13 example."

"This is my first ROT13 excercise!" -->
"Guvf vf zl svefg EBG13 rkprepvfr!"
