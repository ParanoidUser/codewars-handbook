Mr. Square is going on a holiday. He wants to bring 2 of his favorite squares with him, so he put them in his rectangle suitcase.

Write a function that, given the size of the squares and the suitcase, return whether the squares can fit inside the suitcase.
```
fit_in(a,b,m,n)
a,b are the sizes of the squares
m,n are the sizes of the suitcase
```

# Example
```
fit_in(1,2,3,2) should return True
fit_in(1,2,2,1) should return False
fit_in(3,2,3,2) should return False
fit_in(1,2,1,2) should return False
```
