# [Simple Fun #41: Elections Winners](https://www.codewars.com/kata/simple-fun-number-41-elections-winners "https://www.codewars.com/kata/58881b859ab1e053240000cc")

# Task
 Elections are in progress!

 Given an array of the numbers of `votes` given to each of the candidates so far, and an integer `k` equal to the number of voters who haven't cast their vote yet, find the number of candidates who still have a chance to win the election.

 The winner of the election must secure strictly more votes than any other candidate. If two or more candidates receive the same(maximum) number of votes, assume there is no winner at all.

# Example

 For `votes = [2, 3, 5, 2]` and `k = 3`, the output should be `2`
 
 ```
 A,B,C,D have 2,3,5,2 votes
 There are 3 voters haven't cast their vote yet
 
 if 3 voters vote for A: 2 + 3 = 5, 
 His votes does not exceed C(5 votes)
 So A has no chance to win the election
 
 if 3 voters vote for B: 3 + 3 = 6, 
 B(6) will beat other candidates(A->2,C->5,D->2) to win election
 So B has a chance to win the election
 
 if 3 voters vote for C: 5 + 3 = 8, 
 C(8) will beat other candidates(A->2,B->3,D->2) to win election
 So C has a chance to win the election
 
 if 3 voters vote for D: 2 + 3 = 5, 
 His votes does not exceed C(5 votes)
 So D has no chance to win the election
 
 B and C have a chance to win the election,
 The result should be 2
 ```
 For `votes = [3, 1, 1, 3, 1]` and `k = 2`, the output should be `2`
 
 `The 1st,4th candidates have a chance to win the election. The result should be 2.`
 
 For `votes = [1, 3, 3, 1, 1]` and `k = 0`, the output should be `0`
 
 `There is no more voters haven't cast their vote yet, and no candidate secure strictly more votes than any other candidate. So no candidate have a chance to win the election. The result should be 0.`
 
# Input/Output

 - `[input]` integer array `votes`

    A non-empty array of non-negative integers. Its ith element denotes the number of votes cast for the ith candidate.

    Constraints: `4 ? votes.length ? 100000, 0 ? votes[i] ? 10000.`

 - `[input]` integer `k`

    The number of voters who haven't cast their vote yet.

    Constraints: `0 ? k ? 100000.`

- `[output]` an integer
