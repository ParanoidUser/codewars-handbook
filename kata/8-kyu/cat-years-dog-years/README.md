# Kata Task

I have a cat and a dog.

I got them at the same time as kitten/puppy. That was `humanYears` years ago.

Return their respective ages now as [`humanYears`,`catYears`,`dogYears`]

NOTES:
* humanYears >= 1
* humanYears are whole numbers only

## Cat Years

* `15` cat years for first year
* `+9` cat years for second year
* `+4` cat years for each year after that

## Dog Years

* `15` dog years for first year
* `+9` dog years for second year
* `+5` dog years for each year after that
