# [Positive & Negative Regex](https://www.codewars.com/kata/positive-and-negative-regex "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a9a89b4e90137e15e002360")

Your task is pretty easy: to write a regular expression that matches

```
pot
support
Sparta
slap two
respite
deepest
stop-item
a spector
```

but doesn't match

```
pt
Pot
pilates
pilot
parachute
spaghetti
tap
```

Of course, you don't want to hard-code the given examples, because such a solution would not pass the final anti-hard-code-random-value test that uses the same regex pattern you have to find.
