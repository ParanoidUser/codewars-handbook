# [Thinkful - String Drills: Quotable](https://www.codewars.com/kata/thinkful-string-drills-quotable "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5859c82bd41fc6207900007a")

This function should take two string parameters: a person's name (`name`) and a quote of theirs (`quote`), and return a string attributing
the quote to the person in the following format:

```
'[name] said: "[quote]"'
```

For example, if `name` is `'Grae'` and `'quote'` is `'Practice makes perfect'` then your function should return the string

```
'Grae said: "Practice makes perfect"'
```

Unfortunately, something is wrong with the instructions in the function body. Your job is to fix it so the function returns correctly
formatted quotes.
