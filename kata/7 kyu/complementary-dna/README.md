# [Complementary DNA](https://www.codewars.com/kata/complementary-dna "https://www.codewars.com/kata/554e4a2f232cdd87d9000038")

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

If you want to know more http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". 
You have function with one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to get the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

```
DnaStrand.makeComplement("ATTGC") // return "TAACG"

DnaStrand.makeComplement("GTAT") // return "CATA"
```
