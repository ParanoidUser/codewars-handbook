# [Player's Score Class](https://www.codewars.com/kata/players-score-class "https://www.codewars.com/kata/652ff5d8961c81003e87587e")

Most computer games shows the player his score while playing. Often this score only rises, but
sometimes it also can decline (e.g. when you make a wrong answer in a knowledge game).

## Your task

Write a class that holds the current score and manages its current value. All methods are given, you
just have to fill the placeholders. These are marked as TODO comments.

## Hint

The score must not become negative. Instead, it should stay zero.
