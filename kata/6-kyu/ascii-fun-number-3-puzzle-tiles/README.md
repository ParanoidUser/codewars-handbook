You will get two **Integer** `n`(width) and `m` (height) and your task is to draw following pattern. Each line is
seperated with `'\n'`.

- Both integers are equal or greater than 1. No need to check for invalid parameters.
- There are no whitespaces at the end of each line.

For example, for `width = 4` and `height = 3`, you should draw the following pattern:

```
   _( )__ _( )__ _( )__ _( )__
 _|     _|     _|     _|     _|
(_   _ (_   _ (_   _ (_   _ (_
