# [PI approximation](https://www.codewars.com/kata/pi-approximation "https://www.codewars.com/kata/550527b108b86f700000073f")

The aim of the kata is to try to show how difficult it can be to calculate decimals of an irrational number with a certain precision. We have chosen to get a few decimals of the number "pi" using
the following infinite series (Leibniz 1646â€“1716): 

PI / 4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ... which gives an approximation of PI / 4.

To have a measure of the difficulty we will count how many iterations are needed to calculate PI with a given precision. 

There are several ways to determine the precision of the calculus but to keep things easy we will calculate to within epsilon of your language Math::PI constant. In other words we will stop  the iterative process when the absolute value of the difference between our calculation and the Math::PI constant of the given language is less than epsilon.

Your function returns an array or an arrayList or a string or a tuple depending on the language (See sample tests) where your approximation of PI has 10 decimals 

Example :
```
your function calculates 1000 iterations and 3.140592653839794 but returns:
iter_pi(0.001) --> [1000, 3.1405926538]
```

Unfortunately, this series converges too slowly to be useful, 
as it takes over 300 terms to obtain a 2 decimal place precision. 
To obtain 100 decimal places of PI, it was calculated that
one would need to use at least 10^50 terms of this expansion!
