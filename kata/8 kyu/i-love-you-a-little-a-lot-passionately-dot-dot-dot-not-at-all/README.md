Who remembers back to their time in the schoolyard, when girls would take a flower and tear its petals, saying each of the following phrases each time a petal was torn:

- I love you
- a little
- a lot
- passionately

When the last petal was torn there were cries of excitement, dreams, surging thoughts and emotions.
