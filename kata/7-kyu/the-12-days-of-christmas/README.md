Oh No! 

The song sheets have been dropped in the snow and the lines of each verse have become all jumbled up. 

<h1>Task</h1>

You have to write a comparator function which can sort the lines back into their correct order, otherwise Christmas will be cancelled!

Reminder: Below is what the final verse *should* look like

```
On the 12th day of Christmas my true love gave to me
12 drummers drumming,
11 pipers piping, 
10 lords a leaping, 
9 ladies dancing, 
8 maids a milking,
7 swans a swimming, 
6 geese a laying, 
5 golden rings, 
4 calling birds,
3 French hens, 
2 turtle doves and 
a partridge in a pear tree.
