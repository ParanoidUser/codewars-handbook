# [Powers of i](https://www.codewars.com/kata/powers-of-i "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a97387e5ee396e70a00016d")

i is the imaginary unit, it is defined by `i² = -1`, therefore it is a solution to `x²+1=0`.

## Task

is to write a function `pofi` that returns i to the power of a given non-negative integer in its simplest form as a string (answer may contain i).
