# [ATM](https://www.codewars.com/kata/atm "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5635e7cb49adc7b54500001c")

There is enough money available on ATM in nominal value 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 dollars.

You are given money in nominal value of `n` with `1<=n<=1500`.

Try to find minimal number of notes that must be used to repay in
dollars, or output <code lang="java">-1</code> if it is impossible.

Good Luck!!!
