# [Binary Addition](https://www.codewars.com/kata/binary-addition "https://www.codewars.com/kata/551f37452ff852b7bd000139")

Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion
can be done before, or after the addition.

The binary number returned should be a string.

**Examples:(Input1, Input2 --> Output (explanation)))**

```
1, 1 --> "10" (1 + 1 = 2 in decimal or 10 in binary)
5, 9 --> "1110" (5 + 9 = 14 in decimal or 1110 in binary)
```
