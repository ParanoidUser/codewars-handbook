# [Double Char](https://www.codewars.com/kata/double-char "https://www.codewars.com/kata/56b1f01c247c01db92000076")

Given a string, you have to return a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated once.

```
doubleChar("String") ==> "SSttrriinngg"

doubleChar("Hello World") ==> "HHeelllloo  WWoorrlldd"

doubleChar("1234!_ ") ==> "11223344!!__  "
```
