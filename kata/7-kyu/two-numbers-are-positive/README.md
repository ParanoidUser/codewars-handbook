## Task:

Your job is to write a function, which takes three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as arguments, and returns `True` if
exactly two of the three integers are positive numbers (greater than zero), and `False` - otherwise.

## Examples:

```
twoArePositive(2, 4, -3) == true
twoArePositive(-4, 6, 8) == true
twoArePositive(4, -6, 9) == true
twoArePositive(-4, 6, 0) == false
twoArePositive(4, 6, 10) == false
twoArePositive(-14, -3, -4) == false
```
