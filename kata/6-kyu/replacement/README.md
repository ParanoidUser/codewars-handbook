# [Replacement](https://www.codewars.com/kata/replacement "https://www.codewars.com/kata/598d89971928a085c000001a")

Little Petya very much likes sequences. However, recently he received a sequence as a gift from his mother.  
Petya didn't like it at all! He decided to make a single replacement. After this replacement, Petya would like to the sequence in increasing order.  
He asks himself: What is the lowest possible value I could have got after making the replacement and sorting the sequence?

## About the replacement
Choose exactly one element from the sequence and replace it with another integer > 0. You are **not allowed** to replace a number with itself, or to change no number at all.

## Task
Find the lowest possible sequence after performing a valid replacement, and sorting the sequence.

## Input:
Input contains sequence with `N` integers. All elements of the sequence > 0. The sequence will never be empty.

## Output:
Return sequence with `N` integers â€” which includes the lowest possible values of each sequence element, after the single replacement and sorting has been performed.

## Examples:
```
([1,2,3,4,5])  =>  [1,1,2,3,4]
([4,2,1,3,5])  =>  [1,1,2,3,4]
([2,3,4,5,6])  =>  [1,2,3,4,5]
([2,2,2])      =>  [1,2,2]
([42])         =>  [1]
```
