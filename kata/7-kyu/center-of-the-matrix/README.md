# [Center of the Matrix](https://www.codewars.com/kata/center-of-the-matrix "https://www.codewars.com/kata/54c91b5228ec4c3b5900036e")

Create a method that returns the center of a 2-dim array. It should return `null` if there is no single center element.

You can assume all inputs will be rectangular matrices in array form.
ex: `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`
