# [The Lamp](https://www.codewars.com/kata/the-lamp "https://www.codewars.com/kata/56a2e3419f9e920186000004")

Define a class called `Lamp`. It will have attributes for `color` and `state`. Both attributes will be strings and pass into constructor as above order. `Color` will refer to the color of the lamp and `state` will be the string `"on"` if the lamp is on and `"off"` if the lamp is off. You'll need a way to construct a new instance of the class as well as ways to get and set the two attributes it has.
