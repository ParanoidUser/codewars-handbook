# [Thinkful - Number Drills: Blue and red marbles](https://www.codewars.com/kata/thinkful-number-drills-blue-and-red-marbles "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5862f663b4e9d6f12b00003b")

You and a friend have decided to play a game to drill your statistical intuitions. The game works like this:

You have a bunch of red and blue marbles. To start the game you grab a handful of marbles of each color and put them into the bag, keeping track of how many of each color go in. You take turns reaching into the bag, guessing a color, and then pulling one marble out. You get a point if you guessed correctly. The trick is you only have three seconds to make your guess, so you have to think quickly.

You've decided to write a function, `guessBlue()` to help automatically calculate whether you should guess "blue" or "red". The function should take four arguments:

 * the number of blue marbles you put in the bag to start
 * the number of red marbles you put in the bag to start
 * the number of blue marbles pulled out so far, and
 * the number of red marbles pulled out so far.

`guessBlue()` should return the probability of drawing a blue marble, expressed as a float. For example, `guessBlue(5, 5, 2, 3)` should return `0.6`.
