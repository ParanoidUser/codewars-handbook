# [Find Maximum and Minimum Values of a List](https://www.codewars.com/kata/find-maximum-and-minimum-values-of-a-list "577a98a6ae28071780000989")

Your task is to make two functions, ```max``` and ```min``` (`maximum` and `minimum` in PHP and Python) that take a(n) array/vector of integers ```list``` as input and outputs, respectively, the largest and lowest number in that array/vector.

#Examples
```
max({4,6,2,1,9,63,-134,566}) returns 566
min({-52, 56, 30, 29, -54, 0, -110}) returns -110
max({5}) returns 5
min({42, 54, 65, 87, 0}) returns 0
```

#Notes
- You may consider that there will not be any empty arrays/vectors.
