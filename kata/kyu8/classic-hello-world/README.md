# [Classic Hello World][1]

The main mode is having a method named `main` inside a class and should return nothing but should print a line to the standard output with the message `Hello World!` i.e. print the line Hello World! to the console.
For Java the main method should receive `String` array as parameters that can be specified when running from console with the command.
In many traditional programming languages can be only one main for a whole application since it denotes the application entry point.
