# [Java Code Golf: Large Factorials](https://www.codewars.com/kata/java-code-golf-large-factorials "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a5817c4b3bfa8a8c900005e")

In mathematics, the factorial of integer `n` is written as `n!`. It is equal to the product of n and every integer preceding it. For example: `5! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 = 120`

Your mission is simple: Write a function `f` in class `C` that takes an integer `n` and returns the value of `n!` as a string in full. For zero and all negative numbers, assume result of `"1"`.

**Your code must be at or under the par of 140 characters,** whitespace included (compact your code into one line!). (Author's best: 125)
