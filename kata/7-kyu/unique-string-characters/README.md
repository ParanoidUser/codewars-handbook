# [Unique string characters](https://www.codewars.com/kata/unique-string-characters "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a262cfb8f27f217f700000b")

In this Kata, you will be given two strings `a` and `b` and your task will be to return the characters that are not common in the two strings. 

For example:
```
solve("xyab","xzca") = "ybzc" 
--The first string has 'yb' which is not in the second string. 
--The second string has 'zc' which is not in the first string. 
```
Notice also that you return the characters from the first string concatenated with those from the second string.

More examples in the tests cases.
