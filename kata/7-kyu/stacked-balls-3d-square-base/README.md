# [Stacked Balls - 3D (square base)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/stacked-balls-3d-square-base "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5bb493932ce53339dc0000c2")

# Background

I have stacked some cannon balls in a square pyramid.

Like this,

# Kata Task

Given the number of `layers` of my stack, what is the total height?

Return the height as multiple of the ball diameter.

## Example
The image above shows a stack of 4 layers.

## Notes
* `layers` >= 0
* approximate answers (within 0.001) are good enough
