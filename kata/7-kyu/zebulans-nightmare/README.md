# [Zebulan's Nightmare](https://www.codewars.com/kata/zebulans-nightmare "https://www.codewars.com/kata/570fd7ad34e6130455001835")

Zebulan has worked hard to write all his python code in strict compliance to PEP8 rules.  In this kata, you are a mischievous hacker that has set out to sabotage all his good code.

Your job is to take PEP8 compatible function names and convert them to camelCase.  For example:

    zebulansNightmare('camel_case') == 'camelCase'
    zebulansNightmare('zebulans_nightmare') == 'zebulansNightmare'
    zebulansNightmare('get_string') == 'getString'
    zebulansNightmare('convert_to_uppercase') == 'convertToUppercase'
    zebulansNightmare('main') == 'main'
