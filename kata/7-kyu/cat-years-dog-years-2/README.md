# [Cat Years, Dog Years (2)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/cat-years-dog-years-2 "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a6d3bd238f80014a2000187")

I have a cat and a dog which I got as kitten / puppy.

I forget when that was, but I do know their current ages as `catYears` and `dogYears`.

Find how long I have owned each of my pets and return as a list [`ownedCat`, `ownedDog`]

NOTES:
* Results are truncated whole numbers of "human" years

## Cat Years

* `15` cat years for first year
* `+9` cat years for second year
* `+4` cat years for each year after that

## Dog Years

* `15` dog years for first year
* `+9` dog years for second year
* `+5` dog years for each year after that
