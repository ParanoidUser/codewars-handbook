# [Matrix Square Up, B!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/matrix-square-up-b "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a972f30ba1bb5a2590000a0")

Welcome. Welcome all to my very second Kata. As you know, the <a title="first one"         href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a8bcd980025e99381000099">first one</a> was a huge success. This time, however, things are going to be a little bit different. Is it going to be as cool as the last one? Let's find out! Tell your friends! ?




Given an integer b greater than 0, create and return a b X b matrix with the following pattern:
    
    
                         [x,1]
    matrixSquareUp(2) => [2,1]
    
                         [x,x,1]
                         [x,2,1]
    matrixSquareUp(3) => [3,2,1]
    
                         [x,x,x,1]
                         [x,x,2,1]
                         [x,3,2,1]
    matrixSquareUp(4) => [4,3,2,1]
    
Those are lowercase 'x'.

50 > b > 0
