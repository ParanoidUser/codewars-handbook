# [Sorting the Odd way!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/sorting-the-odd-way "https://www.codewars.com/kata/57fb79784e2d0639c9000066")

Given an array of numbers, sort them in such a manner that all the odd numbers in the array are sorted in ascending order and the even numbers are sorted in descending order after the last odd number. For example
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] produces the output [1,3,5,7,9,8,6,4,2]. If the array contains decimals, round them down while checking for odd/even. The output must have the original numbers!
