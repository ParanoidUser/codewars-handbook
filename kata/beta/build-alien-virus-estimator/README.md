# [Build Alien Virus Estimator](https://www.codewars.com/kata/build-alien-virus-estimator "https://www.codewars.com/kata/675851e0ebd55559d1082d24")

A deadly alien virus has escaped from a remote swamp lab, where it was first analyzed. You have to determine their count, so that further
action can be taken. The only catch is that they multiply rapidly.

The crazed professor can only tell you 3 things:

- How many units have escaped
- By how much they increase every minute
- How many minutes have passed

You have to return the # of virus units out there. If the # of units is not deterministic, return -1.

Note: The virus count have been referred to as "units".
