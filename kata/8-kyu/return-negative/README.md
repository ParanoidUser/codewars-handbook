# [Return Negative](https://www.codewars.com/kata/return-negative "https://www.codewars.com/kata/55685cd7ad70877c23000102")

In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

**Example:**
``` 
Kata.makeNegative(1); // return -1
Kata.makeNegative(-5); // return -5
Kata.makeNegative(0); // return 0
```

**Notes:**

- The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
- Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.
