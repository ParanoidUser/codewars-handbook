# [Sum of positive](https://www.codewars.com/kata/sum-of-positive "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5715eaedb436cf5606000381")

You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example `[1,-4,7,12]` => `1 + 7 + 12 = 20`

Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to `0`.
