# [Points of Reflection](https://www.codewars.com/kata/points-of-reflection "https://www.codewars.com/kata/57bfea4cb19505912900012c")

"Point reflection" or "point symmetry" is a basic concept in geometry where a given point, P, at a
given position relative to a mid-point, Q has a corresponding point, P1, which is the same distance
from Q but in the opposite direction.

## Task

Given two points P and Q, output the symmetric point of point P about Q. Each argument is a
two-element array of integers representing the point's X and Y coordinates. Output should be in the
same format, giving the X and Y coordinates of point P1. You do not have to validate the input.
