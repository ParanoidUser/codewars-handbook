# [Write Number in Expanded Form](https://www.codewars.com/kata/write-number-in-expanded-form "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5842df8ccbd22792a4000245")

You will be given a number and you will need to return it as a string in [Expanded Form](https://www.mathplacementreview.com/arithmetic/whole-numbers.php#expanded-form). For example:

```
Kata.expandedForm(12); # Should return "10 + 2"
Kata.expandedForm(42); # Should return "40 + 2"
Kata.expandedForm(70304); # Should return "70000 + 300 + 4"
```

NOTE: All numbers will be whole numbers greater than 0.
