# [Cartesian neighbors](https://www.codewars.com/kata/cartesian-neighbors "https://www.codewars.com/kata/58989a079c70093f3e00008d")

A Cartesian coordinate system is a coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane by a pair of numerical coordinates, which are the signed distances to the point from two fixed perpendicular directed lines, measured in the same unit of length.

The coordinates of a point in the grid are written as (x,y). Each point in a coordinate system has eight neighboring points. Provided that the grid step = 1.

It is necessary to write a function that takes a coordinate on the x-axis and y-axis and returns a list of all the neighboring points. Points inside list don't have to been sorted (any order is valid).

For Example:

```
cartesianNeighbor(2,2) -> {{1,1},{1,2},{1,3},{2,1},{2,3},{3,1},{3,2},{3,3}}
cartesianNeighbor(5,7) -> {{6,7},{6,6},{6,8},{4,7},{4,6},{4,8},{5,6},{5,8}}
```
