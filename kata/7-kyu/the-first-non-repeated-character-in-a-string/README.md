# [The First Non Repeated Character In A String ](https://www.codewars.com/kata/the-first-non-repeated-character-in-a-string "https://www.codewars.com/kata/570f6436b29c708a32000826")

You need to write a function, that returns the first non-repeated character in the given string.

For example for string `"test"` function should return `'e'`.  
For string `"teeter"` function should return `'r'`.  
  
If a string contains all unique characters, then return just the first character of the string.  
Example: for input `"trend"` function should return `'t'`  
  
You can assume, that the input string has always non-zero length.

If there is no repeating character, return `null` in JS or Java, and `None` in Python.
