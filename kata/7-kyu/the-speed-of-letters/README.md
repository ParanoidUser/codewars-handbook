# [The Speed of Letters](https://www.codewars.com/kata/the-speed-of-letters "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5fc7caa854783c002196f2cb")

Given a string as input, return a new string with each letter pushed to the right by its respective index in the alphabet.

We all know that `A` is a slow and `Z` is a fast letter. This means that `Z` gets shifted to the right by 25 spaces, `A` doesn't get shifted at all, and `B` gets shifted by 1 space.

You can assume the following things about your input:

- It will only contain uppercase letters from `A` to `Z`, no whitespaces or punctuation;
- Input strings will not exceed 100 characters (although your output string might!)

Note that if 2 or more letters fall onto the same space after shifting, the latest character will be used. For example: `"BA" -> " A"`


## Examples

```
"AZ"   -->  "A                         Z"
"ABC"  -->  "A B C"
"ACE"  -->  "A  C  E"
"CBA"  -->  "  A"
"HELLOWORLD"  -->  "     E H    DLL   OLO   R  W"
```
