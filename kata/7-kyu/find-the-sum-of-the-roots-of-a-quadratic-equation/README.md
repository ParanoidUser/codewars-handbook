Implement function which will return sum of roots of a quadratic equation rounded to 2 decimal places, if there are any possible roots, else
return **None/null/nil/nothing**. If you use discriminant,when discriminant = 0, x1 = x2 = root => return sum of both roots. There will
always be valid arguments.
