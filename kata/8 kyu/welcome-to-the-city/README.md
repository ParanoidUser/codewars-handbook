# [Welcome to the City](https://www.codewars.com/kata/welcome-to-the-city "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5302d846be2a9189af0001e4")

Create a method `sayHello`/`say_hello`/`SayHello` that takes as input a name, city, and state to welcome a person. Note that `name` will be an array consisting of one or more values that should be joined together with one space betweeen each, and the length of the `name` array in test cases will vary.

Example:
```
sayHello(new String[]{"John", "Smith"}, "Phoenix", "Arizona")
```

This example will return the string `Hello, John Smith! Welcome to Phoenix, Arizona!`
