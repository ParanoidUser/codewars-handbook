You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from `green`, to `yellow`, to `red`, and then to `green` again. 

Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.

For example, `update_light('green')` should return `'yellow'`.
