Write simple .camelCase method (`camel_case` function in PHP, `CamelCase` in C# or `camelCase` in Java) for strings. All words must have their first letter capitalized without spaces.

For instance:
```
camelCase("hello case"); // => "HelloCase"
camelCase("camel case word"); // => "CamelCaseWord"
```
