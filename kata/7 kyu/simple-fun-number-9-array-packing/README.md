# [Simple Fun #9: Array Packing](https://www.codewars.com/kata/simple-fun-number-9-array-packing "https://www.codewars.com/kata/588453ea56daa4af920000ca")

# Task
 You are given an array of up to four non-negative integers, each less than 256.

 Your task is to pack these integers into one number M in the following way:
```
The first element of the array occupies the first 8 bits of M;
The second element occupies next 8 bits, and so on.
```
Return the obtained integer M as unsigned integer.

 - Note: 
 
 the phrase "first bits of M" refers to the least significant bits of M - the right-most bits of an integer. For further clarification see the following example.

# Example

 For `a = [24, 85, 0]`, the output should be `21784`

 An array `[24, 85, 0]` looks like `[00011000, 01010101, 00000000]` in binary.

 After packing these into one number we get `00000000 01010101 00011000` (spaces are placed for convenience), which equals to 21784.

# Input/Output

 - `[input]` integer array `a`

 Constraints: `1 ? a.length ? 4` and `0 ? a[i] < 256`

 - `[output]` an unsigned integer
