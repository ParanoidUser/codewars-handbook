The greatest enemy of all programmers is ";".
Very often we forgot about this symbol.
Also we can forgot about closing brackets (If we don't use IDE that closes brackets for us).

Task: to make a method wich will checks if the brackets "(","{","[" have a couple ")","}","].

For example: "(hello evrybody)" -> true;

"} - bracket" -> false;

"[1] - the first example without (" -> false;
