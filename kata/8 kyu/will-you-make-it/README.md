You were camping with your friends far away from home, but when it's time to go back, you realize that you fuel is running out and the nearest pump is ```50``` miles away! You know that on average, your car runs on about ```25``` miles per gallon. There are ```2``` gallons left. Considering these factors, write a function that tells you if it is possible to get to the pump or not. Function should return ``true`` if it is possible and ``false`` if not.
The input values are always positive.
