## Description:

Remove all exclamation marks from sentence but ensure a exclamation mark at the end of string. For a beginner kata, you can assume that the input data is always a non empty string, no need to verify it.

## Examples

```
"Hi!" ---> "Hi!"
"Hi!!!" ---> "Hi!"
"!Hi" ---> "Hi!"
"!Hi!" ---> "Hi!"
"Hi! Hi!" ---> "Hi Hi!"
"Hi" ---> "Hi!"
```
