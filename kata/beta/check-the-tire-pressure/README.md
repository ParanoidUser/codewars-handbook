# [Check the tire pressure](https://www.codewars.com/kata/check-the-tire-pressure "https://www.codewars.com/kata/56e1bae4f693fe1f8e000cd8")

Yesterday when you drove on motorway your wheel came off. You barely survived. After that you decided to buy a new wheel, and it already had a tire on it. So now you need to check pressure on the tire.

The optimal pressure is 220; Anything below it or above it is either too low or too high.

The program should answer either the pressure is "Too low", "Optimal" or "Too high".
