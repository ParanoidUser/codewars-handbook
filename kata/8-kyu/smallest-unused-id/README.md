# [Smallest unused ID](https://www.codewars.com/kata/smallest-unused-id "https://www.codewars.com/kata/55eea63119278d571d00006a")

Hey awesome programmer!

You've got much data to manage and of course you use zero-based and non-negative ID's to make each data item unique!

Therefore you need a method, which returns the <b>smallest unused ID</b> for your next new data item...

Note: The given array of used IDs may be unsorted. For test reasons there may be duplicate IDs, but you don't have to find or remove them!
