# Your Task
A seaport container terminal stores large containers that are eventually loaded on seagoing ships for
transport abroad. Containers coming to the terminal by road and rail are stacked at the terminal as
they arrive.
Seagoing ships carry large numbers of containers. The time to load a ship depends in part on the
locations of its containers. The loading time increases when the containers are not on the top of the
stacks, but can be fetched only after removing other containers that are on top of them.
The container terminal needs a plan for stacking containers in order to decrease loading time.
The plan must allow each ship to be loaded by accessing only topmost containers on the stacks, and
minimizing the total number of stacks needed.
For this problem, we know the order in which ships must be loaded and the order in which containers
arrive. Each ship is represented by a capital letter between A and Z (inclusive), and the ships will be
loaded in alphabetical order. Each container is labeled with a capital letter representing the ship onto
which it needs to be loaded. There is no limit on the number of containers that can be placed in a
single stack.

# Input
Each test case consists of a single string containing from 1 to
1000 capital letters representing the order of arrival of a set of containers. For example, the string ABAC
means consecutive containers arrive to be loaded onto ships A, B, A, and C, respectively. When all
containers have arrived, the ships are loaded in strictly increasing order: first ship A, then ship B, and
so on.

# Output
For each input case, return the minimum number of stacks needed to store the containers before loading starts.

# Example

```
int Containers("A") = return 1;
int Containers("CBACBACBACBACBA") = return 3;
int Containers("CCCCBBBBAAAA") = return 1;
int Containers("CODEWARS") = return 5;
```
