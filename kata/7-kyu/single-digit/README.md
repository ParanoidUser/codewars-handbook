# [Single digit](https://www.codewars.com/kata/single-digit "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a7778790136a132a00000c1")

The goal of this Kata is to reduce the passed integer to a single digit (if not already) by
converting the number to binary, taking the sum of the binary digits, and if that sum is not a
single digit then repeat the process.

- If the passed integer is already a single digit there is no need to reduce
- `n` will be an integer such that `0 < n < 10⁹`

For example given `5665` the function should return `5`:

```
5665 --> (binary) 1011000100001
1011000100001 --> (sum of binary digits) 5
```

Given `123456789` the function should return `1`:

```
123456789 --> (binary) 111010110111100110100010101
111010110111100110100010101 --> (sum of binary digits) 16
16 --> (binary) 10000
10000 --> (sum of binary digits) 1
```
