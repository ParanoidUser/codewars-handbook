# [Stop Donald Trump (2015)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/stop-donald-trump-2015 "https://www.codewars.com/kata/55d1dbef35672835d3000007")

In this coming November, the United States will be electing a new president. This man (or woman) will be responsible for a great deal of things required by the government. 

Donald Trump is on the loose and he's gunning for this power at full speed ahead. While it is unlikely that he will succeed, it is our duty to stop his schemes.

A common method politicians use is called Gerrymandering. This is when district boundaries are manipulated in such a way that the losing candidate receives a majority of votes in a majority of districts.

In order to stop this, we must create a system that will elect a candidate solely based on votes, not districts or a representative group that's interests may not align with our own. It is our duty to put a stop to this. Write a program that will take the votes from the districts and precincts, and return an array of each candidates vote count.

eg: input = [49,50],[99,100],[21,24],[501,10]
output = [670,184]
