# Code of Codewarrior (武士道)

Codewarrior pledges to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse,
inclusive, and healthy community.

## Virtues

1. `Righteousness (義 gi)`. Be acutely honest throughout your dealings with all people. Codewarrior
   makes a full commitment to their decisions.
2. `Courage (勇 yū)`. Act correctly in day-to-day interactions. Codewarrior must have heroic courage
   to make difficult decisions.
3. `Benevolence (仁, jin)`. Through intense kata training and hard work, the codewarrior becomes
   quick and strong. This power must be used for good.
4. `Respect (礼 rei)`. There is no reason to be rude. A true codewarrior should always respect their
   opponent.
5. `Honesty (誠 makoto)`. A codewarrior never changes the path. They are like a dragonfly, they
   always move forward, never move back.
6. `Honor (名誉 meiyo)`. Codewarrior has only one judge of honor and character, and this is
   themselves. You cannot hide from yourself.
7. `Loyalty (忠義 chūgi)`. Codewarrior is responsible for everything that they have done and
   everything that they have said and all the consequences that follow.
