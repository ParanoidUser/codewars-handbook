# [Principal Diagonal VS Secondary Diagonal](https://www.codewars.com/kata/principal-diagonal-vs-secondary-diagonal "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a8c1b06fd5777d4c00000dd")

**Principal Diagonal** -- The principal diagonal in a matrix identifies those elements of the matrix running from North-West to South-East.

**Secondary Diagonal** -- the secondary diagonal of matrix identifies those elements of the matrix running from North-East to South-West.

For example:
```
matrix:             [1, 2, 3]
                    [4, 5, 6]
                    [7, 8, 9]

principal diagonal: [1, 5, 9]
secondary diagonal: [3, 5, 7]

```

## Task
Your task is to find which diagonal is "larger": which diagonal has a bigger sum of their elements.

* If the principal diagonal is larger, return `"Principal Diagonal win!"`
* If the secondary diagonal is larger, return `"Secondary Diagonal win!"`
* If they are equal, return `"Draw!"`

**Note:** You will always receive matrices of the same dimension.
