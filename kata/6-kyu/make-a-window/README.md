# [Make A Window](https://www.codewars.com/kata/make-a-window "https://www.codewars.com/kata/59c03f175fb13337df00002e")

Make me a window.  I'll give you a number (N).  You return a window.

Rules:

The window will always be 2 x 2.

The window needs to have N number of periods across and N number of periods vertically in each pane.

Example:

```
N = 3

---------
|...|...|
|...|...|
|...|...|
|---+---|
|...|...|
|...|...|
|...|...|
---------
```

Note: there should be no trailing new line characters at the end.
