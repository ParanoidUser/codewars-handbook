# [Are You Playing Banjo?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/are-you-playing-banjo "https://www.codewars.com/kata/53af2b8861023f1d88000832")

Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".  
If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!

The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:
```
name + " plays banjo" 
name + " does not play banjo"
```
Names given are always valid strings.
