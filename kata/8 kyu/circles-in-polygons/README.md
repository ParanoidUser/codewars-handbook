You are the owner of a box making company. 

Your company can produce any equal sided polygon box, but plenty of your customers want to transport circular objects in these boxes. Circles are a very common shape in the consumer industry. Tin cans, glasses, tyres and CD's are a few examples of these.

As a result you decide to add this information on your boxes:
The largest (diameter) circular object that can fit into a given box.
