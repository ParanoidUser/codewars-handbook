# [Sum of Minimums!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/sum-of-minimums "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5d5ee4c35162d9001af7d699")

Given a 2D ( nested ) list ( array, vector, .. ) of size `m LICENSE build.gradle.kts docs gradle gradle.properties gradlew gradlew.bat kata settings.gradle.kts n`, your task is to find the sum of the minimum values in each row.

For Example:

```text
[ [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] # minimum value of row is 1
, [ 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ] # minimum value of row is 5
, [ 20, 21, 34, 56, 100 ] # minimum value of row is 20
]
```

So the function should return `26` because the sum of the minimums is `1 + 5 + 20 = 26`.

Note: You will always be given a non-empty list containing positive values.

ENJOY CODING :)
