# [Wave Sorting](https://www.codewars.com/kata/wave-sorting "https://www.codewars.com/kata/596f28fd9be8ebe6ec0000c1")

A list of integers is sorted in “Wave” order if alternate items are not less than their immediate
neighbors (thus the other alternate items are not greater than their immediate neighbors).

Thus, the array `[4, 1, 7, 5, 6, 2, 3]` is in **Wave** order because 4 >= 1, then 1 <= 7, then 7 >=
5, then 5 <= 6, then 6 >= 2, and finally 2 <= 3.

The wave-sorted lists has to begin with an element not less than the next, so `[1, 4, 5, 3]` is not
sorted in Wave because 1 < 4

Your task is to implement a function that takes a list of integers and sorts it into wave order in
place; your function shouldn't return anything.

Note:

- The resulting array shouldn't necessarily match anyone in the tests, a function just checks if the
  array is now wave sorted.
