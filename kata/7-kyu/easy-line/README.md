# [Easy Line](https://www.codewars.com/kata/easy-line "https://www.codewars.com/kata/56e7d40129035aed6c000632")

In the drawing below we have a part of the Pascal's triangle, lines are numbered from **zero** (top).

We want to calculate the sum of the squares of the binomial coefficients on a given line
with a function called `easyline` (or easyLine or easy-line).

Can you write a program which calculate `easyline(n)` where `n` is the line number?

The function will take n (with: `n>= 0`) as parameter and will return the sum
of the squares of the binomial coefficients on line n.

##Examples:
```
easyline(0) => 1
easyline(1) => 2
easyline(4) => 70
easyline(50) => 100891344545564193334812497256
```

# Note:
In Javascript, Coffeescript, Typescript, C++, PHP, C, R, Nim to get around the fact that we have no big integers
the function `easyLine(n)` will in fact return `round(log(easyline(n)))`  and not the `easyline(n)` of the other languages. So, in Javascript, Coffeescript, Typescript, C++, PHP, R, Nim and C:

```
easyLine(0) => 0
easyLine(1) => 1
easyLine(4) => 4
easyLine(50) => 67
```
