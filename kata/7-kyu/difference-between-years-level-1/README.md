# [Difference between years. (Level 1)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/difference-between-years-level-1 "https://www.codewars.com/kata/588f5a38ec641b411200005b")

Write a function that receives two strings as parameter. These strings are in the following format
of date: `YYYY/MM/DD`. Your job is: Take the `years` and calculate the difference between them.

### Examples:

```
'1997/10/10' and '2015/10/10' -> 2015 - 1997 = returns 18 
'2015/10/10' and '1997/10/10' -> 2015 - 1997 = returns 18
```

At this level, you don't need to validate months and days to calculate the difference.
