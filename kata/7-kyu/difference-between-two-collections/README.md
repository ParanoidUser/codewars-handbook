# [Difference between two collections](https://www.codewars.com/kata/difference-between-two-collections "https://www.codewars.com/kata/594093784aafb857f0000122")

Find the difference between two collections. The difference means that either the character is present in one collection or it is present in other, but not in both. Return a sorted set with difference.

The collections can contain any character and can contain duplicates.

For instance:

A = [a,a,t,e,f,i,j]

B = [t,g,g,i,k,f]

difference = [a,e,g,j,k]
