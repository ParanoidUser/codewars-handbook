# [Longest palindrome](https://www.codewars.com/kata/longest-palindrome "https://www.codewars.com/kata/54bb6f887e5a80180900046b")

Find the length of the longest substring in the given string `s` that is the same in reverse.        

As an example, if the input was “I like racecars that go fast”, the substring (`racecar`) length would be `7`. 

If the length of the input string is `0`, the return value must be `0`. 

## Example

```
"a" -> 1 
"aab" -> 2  
"abcde" -> 1
"zzbaabcd" -> 4
"" -> 0
```
