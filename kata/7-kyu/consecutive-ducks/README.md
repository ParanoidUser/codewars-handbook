Positive integers have so many gorgeous features. 

Some of them could be expressed as a sum of two or more consecutive positive numbers.

# Consider an Example :

* `10` , could be expressed as a sum of `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 `.

# Task

**_Given_** *Positive integer*, N , **_Return_** true if it could be expressed as a sum of two or more consecutive positive numbers , OtherWise return false .

# Notes 

* Guaranteed constraint  :  **_2  â‰¤  N  â‰¤  (2^31) -1_** .

# Input >> Output Examples:


```
* consecutiveDucks(9)  ==>  return (true)  //  9 , could be expressed as a sum of ( 2 + 3 + 4 ) or ( 4 + 5 ) . 
* consecutiveDucks(64)  ==>  return (false)
* consecutiveDucks(42)  ==>  return (true) //  42 , could be expressed as a sum of ( 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 )  .
