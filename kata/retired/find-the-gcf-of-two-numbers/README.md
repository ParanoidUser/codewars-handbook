# [Find the GCF of Two Numbers](https://www.codewars.com/kata/find-the-gcf-of-two-numbers "https://www.codewars.com/kata/579e3476cf1fa55592000045")

Your task here is the find the GCF (Greatest Common Factor) of any two numbers passed into a method, which will return one integer answer as an output.

Examples:
```
findGCF(4, 6); // Should return 2
findGCF(93, 186); // Should return 93
findGCF(20, 5); // Should return 5
```

Here, inputs will always be natural numbers so there's no need to worry about negative values or zero.
