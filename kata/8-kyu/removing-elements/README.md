# [Removing Elements](https://www.codewars.com/kata/removing-elements "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5769b3802ae6f8e4890009d2")

Take an array and remove every second element from the array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the
next element.

### Example:

`["Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...]` --> `["Keep", "Keep", "Keep", ...]`

None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!
