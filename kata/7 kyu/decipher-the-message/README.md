Amy and May aren't allowed by their parents to have cell phones, so they still communicate in class the good old fashioned way, by writing notes. 

So that no snoopy teachers can read any found notes, the girls communicate in code. 

May is having a hard time deciphering Amy's latest messages, can you help her figure it out?

Input: String written in Amy's code
Output: String decoded to English so May can read it
