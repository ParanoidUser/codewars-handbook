# [Isograms](https://www.codewars.com/kata/isograms "https://www.codewars.com/kata/54ba84be607a92aa900000f1")

An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

```
isIsogram("Dermatoglyphics") == true
isIsogram("aba") == false
isIsogram("moOse") == false // -- ignore letter case
```
