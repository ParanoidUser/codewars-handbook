# [Find the Slope](https://www.codewars.com/kata/find-the-slope "https://www.codewars.com/kata/55a75e2d0803fea18f00009d")

Given an array of 4 integers  
```[a,b,c,d]``` representing two points ```(a, b)``` and ```(c, d)```, return a string representation of the slope of the line joining these two points. 

For an undefined slope (division by 0), return  ```undefined```  . Note that the "undefined" is case-sensitive.
```
   a:x1
   b:y1
   c:x2
   d:y2```
   
Assume that ```[a,b,c,d]``` and the answer are all integers 
(no floating numbers!).
