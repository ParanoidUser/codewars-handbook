# [Lost number of arithmetic progression](https://www.codewars.com/kata/lost-number-of-arithmetic-progression "https://www.codewars.com/kata/6001bd346aad3700267576bc")

I'm terribly tired, so I made a crooked algorithm to construct an arithmetic progression...<br>
Please help me find the missing number.
The conditions are:<br>
• The length of the array is always greater than 4 and less than 1000;<br>
• The numbers in the arrays are between -10000 and 10000;<br>
• Return the number, and if it's OK, return the next one (1, 3, 5, 7 => 9)
