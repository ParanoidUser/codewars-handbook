# [Stacked Balls - 3D (triangle base)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/stacked-balls-3d-triangle-base "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5bbad1082ce5333f8b000006")

I have stacked some cannon balls in a triangle-based pyramid.

Like this,

## Task

Given the number of `layers` of my stack, what is the total height?

Return the height as multiple of the ball diameter.

## Example

The image above shows a stack of 3 layers.

## Notes

* `layers` >= 0
* approximate answers (within 0.001) are good enough
