# [Simpson's Rule - Approximate Integration](https://www.codewars.com/kata/simpsons-rule-approximate-integration "https://www.codewars.com/kata/565abd876ed46506d600000d")

An integral:

```math
\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx
```
can be approximated by the so-called Simpsonâ€™s rule:

```math
\dfrac{b-a}{3n}(f(a)+f(b)+4\sum_{i=1}^{n/2}f(a+(2i-1)h)+2\sum_{i=1}^{n/2-1}f(a+2ih))
```
Here
`h = (b - a) / n`, `n` being an even integer and `a <= b`.

We want to try Simpson's rule with the function f:

```math
f(x) = \frac{3}{2}\sin(x)^3
```

The task is to write a function called `simpson` with parameter `n` which returns the value of the integral of f on the interval `[0, pi]` (pi being 3.14159265359...).

#### Notes:
- Don't round or truncate your results. See in "RUN EXAMPLES" the function `assertFuzzyEquals` or `testing`.
- `n` will always be even.
- We know that the exact value of the integral of f on the given interval is `2`.
- Please ask before translating.
