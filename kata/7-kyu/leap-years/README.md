# [Leap Years](https://www.codewars.com/kata/leap-years "https://www.codewars.com/kata/526c7363236867513f0005ca")

In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap year or not. In case you don't know the rules,
here they are:

* years divisible by 4 are leap years
* but years divisible by 100 are **not** leap years
* but years divisible by 400 are leap years

Additional Notes:

* Only valid years (positive integers) will be tested, so you don't have to validate them

Examples can be found in the test fixture.
