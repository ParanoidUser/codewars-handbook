The two oldest ages function/method needs to be completed. It should take an array of numbers as its argument and return the **two highest
numbers within the array**. The returned value should be an array in the format `[second oldest age, oldest age]`.

The order of the numbers passed in could be any order. The array will always include at least 2 items. If there are two or more oldest age,
then return both of them in array format.

**For example (Input --> Output):**

```
[1, 2, 10, 8] --> [8, 10]
[1, 5, 87, 45, 8, 8] --> [45, 87]
[1, 3, 10, 0]) --> [3, 10]
```
