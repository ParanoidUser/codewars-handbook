## Related Kata

Although this Kata is not part of an official Series, you may also want to try out [Parse a linked list from a string](https://www.codewars.com/kata/582c5382f000e535100001a7) if you enjoyed this Kata.

## Preloaded

Preloaded for you is a class, struct or derived data type `Node` (depending on the language) used to construct linked lists in this Kata:

```
class Node {
	private int data;
	private Node next;
	
	public Node(int data, Node next) {
		this.data = data;
		this.next = next;
	}
	
	public Node(int data) {
		this.data = data;
		this.next = null;
	}

	public int getData() {
		return data;
	}

	public Node getNext() {
		return next;
	}
}
```


If you are attempting this Kata in NASM then note that the code example shown directly above may not be relevant; please refer to the Sample Tests (written in C) for the exact definition of the `Node` structure.

## Prerequisites

This Kata assumes that you are already familiar with the idea of a linked list.  If you do not know what that is, you may want to read up on [this article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list).  Specifically, the linked lists this Kata is referring to are **singly linked lists**, where the value of a specific node is stored in its `data`/`$data`/`Data` property, the reference to the next node is stored in its `next`/`$next`/`Next`/`next_node` property and the terminator for a list is `null`/`NULL`/`None`/`nil`/`nullptr`/`null()`.

## Task

*If you are attempting this Kata in NASM, the code examples shown below may not be relevant at all - please refer to the Sample Tests (written in C) for the exact requirements.*

Create a function `stringify` which accepts an argument `list`/`$list` and returns a string representation of the list.  The string representation of the list starts with the value of the current `Node`, specified by its `data`/`$data`/`Data` property, followed by a whitespace character, an arrow and another whitespace character (`" -> "`), followed by the rest of the list.  The end of the string representation of a list must always end with `null`/`NULL`/`None`/`nil`/`nullptr`/`null()` (all caps or all lowercase depending on the language you are undertaking this Kata in).  For example, given the following list:

```java
new Node(1, new Node(2, new Node(3)))
```

... its string representation would be:

```
"1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null"
```

And given the following linked list:

```
new Node(0, new Node(1, new Node(4, new Node(9, new Node(16)))))
```

... its string representation would be:

```
"0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 -> null"
```

Note that `null`/`NULL`/`None`/`nil`/`nullptr`/`null()` itself is also considered a valid linked list.  In that case, its string representation would simply be `"null"`/`"NULL"`/`"None"`/`"nil"`/`"nullptr"`/`@"NULL"`/`"null()"` (again, depending on the language).

For the simplicity of this Kata, you may assume that any `Node` in this Kata may only contain **non-negative integer** values.  For example, you will not encounter a `Node` whose `data`/`$data`/`Data` property is `"Hello World"`.
