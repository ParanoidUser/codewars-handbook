# [Pizza Party #1 - How many pizzas do we need](https://www.codewars.com/kata/pizza-party-number-1-how-many-pizzas-do-we-need "https://www.codewars.com/kata/67785cb55afb1ba50d5de514")

## **Description**

You're at a party, everything is great, and everyone wants pizza. But there's a twist—nobody agrees on how to count pizza slices! One person
says he need `1/2` slices of pizza, another says `3/4`, and someone boldly declares `10/12`.

Your mission: ensure everyone gets their requested slices by calculating how many **whole pizzas** to order. Remember, you can only order *
*complete pizzas**—no partial ones!

---

## **Example**

Person 1 wants `3/4` of a pizza.
This means they want three out of the four slices that make up one whole pizza.

Person 2 wants `5/4` of a pizza.
This means they want more than one full pizza. In fact, they want one whole pizza `(4/4)` plus an additional slice, making a total of `5/4`.

Now, let's add the slices together: 3/4 + 5/4 = 8/4. This means the total amount of pizza needed is equivalent to two full pizzas (since
8/4 = 2).
