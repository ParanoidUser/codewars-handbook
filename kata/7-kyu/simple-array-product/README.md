# [Simple array product](https://www.codewars.com/kata/simple-array-product "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5d0365accfd09600130a00c9")

In this Kata, you will be given a multi-dimensional array containing `2 or more` sub-arrays of integers. Your task is to find the maximum product that can be formed by taking any one element from each sub-array.

```
Examples:
solve( [[1, 2],[3, 4]] ) = 8. The max product is given by 2 * 4
solve( [[10,-15],[-1,-3]] ) = 45, given by (-15) * (-3)
solve( [[1,-1],[2,3],[10,-100]] ) = 300, given by (-1) * 3 * (-100)
```
