# [80's Kids #3: Punky Brewster's Socks](https://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-3-punky-brewsters-socks "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5662292ee7e2da24e900012f")

Punky loves wearing different colored socks, but Henry can't stand it.

Given an array of different colored socks, return a pair depending on who was picking them out.

Example:
```
getSocks("Punky", ["red","blue","blue","green"]) -> ["red", "blue"]
```

Note that Punky can have any two colored socks, in any order, as long as they are different and both exist. Henry always picks a matching pair. 

If there is no possible combination of socks, return an empty array.
