Generators can be used to wonderful things. You can use them for numerous things, but here is one specific example. You are studying for a test so you must practice your multiplication, but you don't have a multiplication table showing the different examples. You have decided to create a generator that prints out a limitless list of time tables.

## Task

Your generator must take one parameter `a` then every time the generator is called you must return a string in the format of: `'a x b = c'` where c is the answer. Also, the value of `b`, which starts at 1, must increment by 1 each time!
