# [Target Date](https://www.codewars.com/kata/target-date "https://www.codewars.com/kata/569218bc919ccba77000000b")

You have an amount of money `a0 > 0` and you deposit it with a constant interest rate of `p% > 0` per **year** on the
`1st of January 2016`. You want to have an amount `a >= a0`.

## Task:
The function `date_nb_days` (or dateNbDays...) with parameters `a0, a, p` will return, as a string, the date on which you
have just reached `a`.

## Example:
`date_nb_days(100, 101, 0.98) --> "2017-01-01" (366 days)`

`date_nb_days(100, 150, 2.00) --> "2035-12-26" (7299 days)`

## Notes:
- The return format of the date is `"YYYY-MM-DD"`
- The deposit is always on the `"2016-01-01"`
- If `p%` is the rate for a year the rate for a day is `p divided by
  36000` since banks consider that there are `360` days in a year.
- You have: `a0 > 0, p% > 0, a >= a0`
