# [Help the Fruit Guy](https://www.codewars.com/kata/help-the-fruit-guy "https://www.codewars.com/kata/557af4c6169ac832300000ba")

Our fruit guy has a bag of fruit (represented as an array of strings) where some fruits are rotten. He wants to replace all the rotten pieces of fruit with fresh ones. For example, given `["apple","rottenBanana","apple"]` the replaced array should be `["apple","banana","apple"]`. Your task is to implement a method that accepts an array of strings containing fruits should returns an array of strings where all the rotten fruits are replaced by good ones. 

### Notes

- If the array is null/nil/None or empty you should return empty array (`[]`).
- The rotten fruit name will be in this camelcase (`rottenFruit`).
- The returned array should be in lowercase.
