Given a positive integer ```n: 0 < n < 1e6```, remove the last digit until you're left with a number that is a multiple of three.

Return `n` if the input is already a multiple of three, and return ```null``` if no such number exists.

Examples

1      => null

25     => null

36     => 36

1244   => 12

952406 => 9
