# [Max Consecutive Sum](https://www.codewars.com/kata/max-consecutive-sum "https://www.codewars.com/kata/6033fe27779179000a28cb57")

Given an integer ```num```, return the smallest and largest integers in a sequence of consecutive integers that sum to ```num```. There may be multiple sequences that work; return the sequence with the largest number of consecutive integers. Return ```null``` if there are no solutions of at least 2 consecutive integers.

Example:

```maxConsecutiveSum(45)``` returns ```[1,9]```.

Notice that ```[14,16]``` is also a valid range that adds to 45, but there is another solution with a larger number of consecutive integers.
