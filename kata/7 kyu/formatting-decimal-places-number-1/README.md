# [Formatting decimal places #1](https://www.codewars.com/kata/formatting-decimal-places-number-1 "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5641c3f809bf31f008000042")

Each floating-point number should be formatted that only the first two decimal places are returned. You don't need to check whether the input is a valid number because only valid numbers are used in the tests.  

Don't round the numbers! Just cut them after two decimal places!

Right examples:  
32.8493 is 32.84  
14.3286 is 14.32

Incorrect examples (e.g. if you round the numbers):  
32.8493 is 32.85  
14.3286 is 14.33
