# [Stanton measure](https://www.codewars.com/kata/stanton-measure "https://www.codewars.com/kata/59a1cdde9f922b83ee00003b")

The `Stanton` measure of an array is computed as follows: count the number of `1`s in the array. Let this count be `n`. The `Stanton` measure is the number of times that `n` appears in the array. 

Write a function which takes an integer array and returns its `Stanton` measure.

## Example

The Stanton measure of `[1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2]` is `3`, because `1` occurs `2` times in the array and `2` occurs `3` times.
