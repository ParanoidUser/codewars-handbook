# [Fractions class](https://www.codewars.com/kata/fractions-class "https://www.codewars.com/kata/572bbd7c72a38bd878000a73")

You are provided with a skeleton of the class 'Fraction', which accepts two arguments (numerator, denominator).

## Example

```
Fraction fraction1 = new Fraction(4, 5);
```

Your task is to make this class string representable, and addable while keeping the result in the minimum representation possible.

```
System.out.println(fraction1.add(new Fraction(1, 8)));
// Outputs: 37/40
```

NB: DON'T use the built_in class 'fractions.Fraction'
