# [Calculate Fibonacci return count of digit occurrences](https://www.codewars.com/kata/calculate-fibonacci-return-count-of-digit-occurrences "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5779f894ec8832493f00002d")

Fibonacci numbers are generated by setting F<sub>0</sub> = 0, F<sub>1</sub> = 1, and then using the
formula:

# F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub>

Your task is to efficiently calculate the **n**th element in the Fibonacci sequence and then count
the occurrence of each digit in the number. Return a list of integer pairs sorted in **descending**
order.

10 ≤ n ≤ 100000

## Examples

```
f(10) = 55  # returns [(2, 5)], as there are two occurances of digit 5

f(10000)    # returns:
  [(254, 3),
   (228, 2),
   (217, 6),
   (217, 0),
   (202, 5),
   (199, 1),
   (198, 7),
   (197, 8),
   (194, 4),
   (184, 9)]
```

If two integers have the same count, sort them in descending order.

Your algorithm must be efficient.
