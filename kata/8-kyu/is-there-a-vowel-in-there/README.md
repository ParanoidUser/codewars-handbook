# [Is there a vowel in there?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/is-there-a-vowel-in-there "https://www.codewars.com/kata/57cff961eca260b71900008f")

Given an array of numbers, check if any of the numbers are the character codes for lower case vowels (`a, e, i, o, u`).

If they are, change the array value to a string of that vowel.

`input [100,100,116,105,117,121]=>[100,100,116,"i","u",121] output`
Return the resulting array.
