# [The Modulo-3 Sequence](https://www.codewars.com/kata/the-modulo-3-sequence "https://www.codewars.com/kata/589d33e4e0bbce5d6300061c")

Consider a sequence where the first two numbers are `0` and `1` and the next number of the sequence is the sum of the previous 2 modulo 3. Write a function that finds the nth number of the sequence.

## Constraints:
* 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^19

## Example:

```
sequence(1);
0
sequence(2);
1
sequence(3);
1
```
