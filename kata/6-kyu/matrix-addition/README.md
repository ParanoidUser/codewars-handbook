# [Matrix Addition](https://www.codewars.com/kata/matrix-addition "https://www.codewars.com/kata/526233aefd4764272800036f")

Write a function that accepts two square matrices (`N x N` two dimensional arrays), and return the sum of the two. Both matrices being passed into the function will be of size `N x N` (square), containing only integers.

How to sum two matrices:

Take each cell `[n][m]` from the first matrix, and add it with the same `[n][m]` cell from the second matrix. This will be cell `[n][m]` of the solution matrix.

Visualization: 
```
|1 2 3|     |2 2 1|     |1+2 2+2 3+1|     |3 4 4|
|3 2 1|  +  |3 2 3|  =  |3+3 2+2 1+3|  =  |6 4 4|
|1 1 1|     |1 1 3|     |1+1 1+1 1+3|     |2 2 4|
```

## Example
```
matrixAddition(
  [ [1, 2, 3],
    [3, 2, 1],
    [1, 1, 1] ],
//      +
  [ [2, 2, 1],
    [3, 2, 3],
    [1, 1, 3] ] )

// returns:
  [ [3, 4, 4],
    [6, 4, 4],
    [2, 2, 4] ]
```
