# [Row of the odd triangle](https://www.codewars.com/kata/row-of-the-odd-triangle "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5d5a7525207a674b71aa25b5")

Given a triangle of consecutive odd numbers:

```
             1
          3     5
       7     9    11
   13    15    17    19
21    23    25    27    29
...
```

find the triangle's row knowing its index (the rows are 1-indexed), e.g.:

```
odd_row(1)  ==  [1]
odd_row(2)  ==  [3, 5]
odd_row(3)  ==  [7, 9, 11]
```

**Note**: your code should be optimized to handle big inputs.
