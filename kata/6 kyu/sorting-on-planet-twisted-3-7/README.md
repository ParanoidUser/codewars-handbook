# [Sorting on planet Twisted-3-7](https://www.codewars.com/kata/sorting-on-planet-twisted-3-7 "https://www.codewars.com/kata/58068479c27998b11900056e")

There is a planet... in a galaxy far far away. It is exactly like our planet, but it has one difference:

## The values of the digits 3 and 7 are twisted.
Our 3 means 7 on the planet Twisted-3-7. And 7 means 3.

Your task is to create a method, that can sort an array the way it would be sorted on Twisted-3-7.

7 Examples from a friend from Twisted-3-7:
```
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] -> [1,2,7,4,5,6,3,8,9]
[12,13,14] -> [12,14,13]
[9,2,4,7,3] -> [2,7,4,3,9]
```

There is no need for a precheck. The array will always be not null and will always contain at least one number.

You should not modify the input array!
