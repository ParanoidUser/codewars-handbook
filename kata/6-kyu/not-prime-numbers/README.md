# [Not prime numbers](https://www.codewars.com/kata/not-prime-numbers "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a9a70cf5084d74ff90000f7")

You are given two positive integers `a` and `b` (`a < b <= 20000`). Complete the function which returns a list of all those numbers in the interval `[a, b)` whose digits are made up of prime numbers (`2, 3, 5, 7`) but which are not primes themselves.

Be careful about your timing!
