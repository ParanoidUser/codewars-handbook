Let us take a string composed of decimal digits: `"10111213"`. We want to code this string
as a string of `0` and `1` and after that be able to decode it.

We decompose the given string in its decimal digits `1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3` and we will code each.

### Coding process to code a number n expressed in base 10:

a) Let `k` be the number of *bits* of `n`

b) Put `k-1` times the digit `0` followed by the digit `1`

c) Put number `n` in binary

d) Concat the result of b) and c)

So we code `0` as `10`, `1` as `11` ...  etc...

Repeating this process with the initial string

`"10111213"` becomes : `"11101111110110110111"` resulting of concatenation of `11 10 11 11 11 0110 11 0111` .

### Task:
- Given `strng` a string of digits representing a decimal number the function `code(strng)` should return the coding of `strng` as explained above.

- Given a string `strng` resulting from the previous coding, decode it to get the corresponding decimal string.

### Examples:

```
code("77338855") --> "001111001111011101110001100000011000001101001101"
code("77338")  --> "0011110011110111011100011000"
code("0011121314") --> "1010111111011011011111001100"

decode("001111001111011101110001100000011000001101001101") -> "77338855"
decode("0011110011110111011100011000") -> "77338"
decode("1010111111011011011111001100") -> "0011121314"

```
