[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) is an educational online platform for computer programming. On
the platform, users aka "*code warriors*" try to solve programming challenges known as "*kata*" to
practice programming skills and gain honor points, which represent the level of respect a user has
earned from the community. Each kata is set to a kyū rank, based on its subject area and difficulty.
The harder the kata, the more points. Every new codewarrior is ranked as 8 kyū (Beginner) and can
advance through the ranks by completing kata at or above their rank to reach the final 4th dan
(Master). Kyū indicates the number of degrees away from the master level. This is why they count
downward. Once you reach the master level, we count upward. Enough said... Banzai!

## Overview

The repository contains a collection of Java solutions for Codewars challenges grouped by a kyū
rank. Each kata is placed in a separate folder named by its slug and accompanied by a task
description, a solution source code, and verification tests. All solutions were solved
on [the official platform](https://www.codewars.com) and verified against the original test suite.

repository.

incompatible with Java 8, and 11 versions.

thinking about your own approaches to solving the challenge. Keep in mind, by using materials of
this repository to gain rank, you
