# [Halving Sum](https://www.codewars.com/kata/halving-sum "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a58d46cfd56cb4e8600009d")

Given a positive integer n, calculate the following sum:
```
n + n/2 + n/4 + n/8 + ....
```
All divisions are integer.

## Example

```
For n = 25, the output should be
halvingSum(n) = 47.
```

The sum to be calculated is ```25 + 12 + 6 + 3 + 1```, which is ```47```.
