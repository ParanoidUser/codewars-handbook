# [Price of Mangoes](https://www.codewars.com/kata/price-of-mangoes "https://www.codewars.com/kata/57a77726bb9944d000000b06")

There's a **"3 for 2"** (or **"2+1"** if you like) offer on mangoes. For a given quantity and price (per mango), calculate the total cost of the mangoes.

### Examples
```python
mango(2, 3) ==> 6 # 2 mangoes for $3 per unit = $6; no mango for free
mango(3, 3) ==> 6 # 2 mangoes for $3 per unit = $6; +1 mango for free
mango(5, 3) ==> 12 # 4 mangoes for $3 per unit = $12; +1 mango for free
mango(9, 5) ==> 30 # 6 mangoes for $5 per unit = $30; +3 mangoes for free
```
