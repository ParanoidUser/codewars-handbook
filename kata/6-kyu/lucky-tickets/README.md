In one city, bus tickets use numbers from **100000** to **999999**. Your task is to find the number of lucky tickets between two input tickets' values.

The ticket is considered to be lucky if the sum of first 3 digits equals to the sum of last 3 digits:  
**123321** is lucky, i.e. **1+2+3** equals to **3+2+1**<br>
**123444** is not lucky, i.e. **1+2+3** doesn't equal to **4+4+4**
