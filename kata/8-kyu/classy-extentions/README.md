# Classy Extensions
The goal of this kata is to train the basic OOP concepts of inheritance and method overriding.

You will be preloaded with the `Animal` class, so you should only edit the `Cat` class.

### Task
Your task is to complete the `Cat` class which extends `Animal` and replace the `speak` method to return the cats name + meows.
e.g. `'Mr Whiskers meows.'`
