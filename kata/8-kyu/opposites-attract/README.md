Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love. 

Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.
