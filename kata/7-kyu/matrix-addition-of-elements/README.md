# [Matrix Addition of Elements](https://www.codewars.com/kata/matrix-addition-of-elements "https://www.codewars.com/kata/58bc8304b238c8e29b0000f6")

As the name suggests you just have to add all the elements of the matrix
and output a single Integer.

- Matrix can be of any size, not necessarily a square matrix.
- Matrix can have negative elements as well.
- Method should take an input 2-Dimensional Array.

**Constraints**

`1 <= rows, columns < 20`

`-100 <= elements <= 100`

**Example**
```
SumOfElements({{1,0},{0,1}}) should return 2.
SumOfElements({{7,9},{3,6}}) should return 25.
```
