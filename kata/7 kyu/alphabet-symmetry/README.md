# [Alphabet symmetry](https://www.codewars.com/kata/alphabet-symmetry "https://www.codewars.com/kata/59d9ff9f7905dfeed50000b0")

Consider the word `"abode"`. We can see that the letter `a` is in position `1` and `b` is in position `2`. In the alphabet, `a` and `b` are also in positions `1` and `2`. Notice also that `d` and `e` in `abode` occupy the positions they would occupy in the alphabet, which are positions `4` and `5`. 

Given an array of words, return an array of the number of letters that occupy their positions in the alphabet for each word. For example,
```
solve(["abode","ABc","xyzD"]) = [4, 3, 1]
```
See test cases for more examples.

Input will consist of alphabet characters, both uppercase and lowercase. No spaces.

Good luck!
