# [No ifs no buts](https://www.codewars.com/kata/no-ifs-no-buts "https://www.codewars.com/kata/592915cc1fad49252f000006")

Write a function that accepts two numbers `a` and `b` and returns whether `a` is smaller than, bigger than, or equal to `b`, as a string.

```
(5, 4) ---> "5 is greater than 4"
(-4, -7) ---> "-4 is greater than -7"
(2, 2) ---> "2 is equal to 2"
```

There is only one problem...

You cannot use `if` statements, and you cannot use the ternary operator `? :`.

In fact the word `if` and the character `?` are not allowed in your code.
