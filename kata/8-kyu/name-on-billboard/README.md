# [Name on billboard](https://www.codewars.com/kata/name-on-billboard "https://www.codewars.com/kata/570e8ec4127ad143660001fd")

You can print your name on a billboard ad. Find out how much it will cost you. Each character has a
default price of £30, but that can be different if you are given 2 parameters instead of 1 (allways
2 for Java).

You can not use multiplier "*" operator.

If your name would be Jeong-Ho Aristotelis, ad would cost £600.
20 leters * 30 = 600 (Space counts as a character).
