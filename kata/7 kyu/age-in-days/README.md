# [Age in days](https://www.codewars.com/kata/age-in-days "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5803753aab6c2099e600000e")

Did you ever want to know how many days you are old?
Write a function ageInDays which returns your age in days.

For example if today is 30 November 2015 then 
```
ageInDays(2015, 11, 1) returns "You are 29 days old"
```

The birthday is entered as integers in the following order 
```
ageInDays(year, month, day)
```
For example if you are born 27 November 2007 then call ageInDays(2007, 11, 27).

Your birthday is expected to be in the past.
