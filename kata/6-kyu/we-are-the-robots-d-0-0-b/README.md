------------------------------------------------------------------
 we are programmed just to do anything you want us to

-----------------------------------------------------------[ d[(0)(0)]b]
```
Task.....
You will receive an array of strings
such as 
```
a = ["We're functioning automatik d[(0)(0)]b","And we are dancing mechanik d[(0)(0)]b"]
```
Count the robots represented by d[(0)(0)]b

Unless of course the factory replaced a part on the robot.....
```
d[(0)(0)]b could look a little different depending on the supplier maybe like this 

d[(0)(0)]B or d[(0)(0}]B 
```
It's pretty random actually but with a global supply chain it's hard to control which part you get. Most of the parts are made global except the ones made in the factory which do not change.

```
d[(0)(0)]B 

In all robots the eyes do not change.

d[(0)(0)]B 

...0..0...
   ^  ^            
   |  | 

The rest of the body can change at random.

legs any in => abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
...0..0... 
^        ^             
|        |

body any in => |};&#[]/><()*


...0..0... 
 ^^ ^^ ^^            
 || || ||           


```
There may be cases where a part is totally missing and of course a robot cannot function at all without a part or where the factory put a valid part in the wrong place and it's again not a valid robot.

return an array of strings with a count of each of the following tasks.

Case-insensitive count of robots in string with "automatik" or "mechanik". Strings do not contain both "automatik and "mechanik". 

Return an array with the count like below 

```
a[0] = automatik count
a[1] = mechanik count

["1 robots functioning automatik", "1 robots dancing mechanik"]

```
