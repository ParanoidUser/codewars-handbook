Consider a sequence made up of the consecutive prime numbers. This infinite sequence would start with: 
```
"2357111317192329313741434753596167717379..."
```

You will be given two numbers: `a` and `b`, and your task will be to return `b` elements starting from index `a` in this sequence.
```
For example:
solve(10,5) == `19232` Because these are 5 elements from index 10 in the sequence.
```

Tests go up to about index `20000`.
