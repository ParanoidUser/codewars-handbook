# Welcome to the Codewars Bar!

Codewars Bar recommends you drink 1 glass of water per standard drink so you're not hungover tomorrow morning.

Your fellow coders have bought you several drinks tonight in the form of a string.  Return a string suggesting how many glasses of water you should drink to not be hungover.
