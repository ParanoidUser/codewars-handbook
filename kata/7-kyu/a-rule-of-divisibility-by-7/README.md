# [A Rule of Divisibility by 7](https://www.codewars.com/kata/a-rule-of-divisibility-by-7 "https://www.codewars.com/kata/55e6f5e58f7817808e00002e")

A number m of the form 10x + y is divisible by 7 if and only if x - 2y is divisible by 7. In other words, subtract twice the last digit 
from the number formed by the remaining digits. Continue to do this until a number known to be divisible or not by 7 is obtained; 
you can stop when this number has *at most* 2 digits because you are supposed to know if a number of at most 2 digits is divisible by 7 or not.

The original number is divisible by 7 if and only if the last number obtained using this procedure is divisible by 7. 

Examples:

1 - `m = 371 -> 37 ? (2�1) -> 37 ? 2 = 35` ; thus, since 35 is divisible by 7, 371 is divisible by 7. 

The number of steps to get the result is `1`.

2 - `m = 1603 -> 160 - (2 x 3) -> 154 -> 15 - 8 = 7` and 7 is divisible by 7. 

3 - `m = 372 -> 37 ? (2�2) -> 37 ? 4 = 33` ; thus, since 33 is not divisible by 7, 372 is not divisible by 7. 

The number of steps to get the result is `1`.

4 - `m = 477557101->47755708->4775554->477547->47740->4774->469->28` and 28 is divisible by 7, so is 477557101. 

The number of steps is 7.

# Task:
Your task is to return to the function ```seven(m)``` (m integer >= 0) an array (or a pair, depending on the language) of numbers, 
the first being the *last* number `m` with at most 2 digits obtained by your function (this last `m` will be divisible or not by 7), the second one being the number of steps to get the result.

## Forth Note:
Return on the stack `number-of-steps, last-number-m-with-at-most-2-digits `

## Examples:
```
seven(371) should return [35, 1]
seven(1603) should return [7, 2]
seven(477557101) should return [28, 7]
```
