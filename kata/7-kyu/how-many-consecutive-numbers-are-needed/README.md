# [How many consecutive numbers are needed?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/how-many-consecutive-numbers-are-needed "https://www.codewars.com/kata/559cc2d2b802a5c94700000c")

Create the function ```consecutive(arr)``` that takes an array of integers and return the minimum number of integers needed to make the contents of ```arr``` consecutive from the lowest number to the highest number.<br/><br/>
For example: <br/> If ```arr``` contains [4, 8, 6] then the output should be 2 because two numbers need to be added to the array (5 and 7) to make it a consecutive array of numbers from 4 to 8. Numbers in ```arr``` will be unique.
