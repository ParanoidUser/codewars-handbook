# [Latin Squares](https://www.codewars.com/kata/latin-squares "https://www.codewars.com/kata/645fb55ecf8c290031b779ef")

A **latin square** is an n Ã— n array filled with the integers 1 to n, each occurring once in each row and column.

Here are examples of latin squares of size 4 and 7:

```
[[1, 4, 3, 2],      [[2, 3, 1, 7, 4, 6, 5], 
 [4, 3, 2, 1],       [7, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4, 3], 
 [3, 2, 1, 4],       [6, 7, 5, 4, 1, 3, 2], 
 [2, 1, 4, 3]]       [4, 5, 3, 2, 6, 1, 7], 
                     [5, 6, 4, 3, 7, 2, 1], 
                     [1, 2, 7, 6, 3, 5, 4], 
                     [3, 4, 2, 1, 5, 7, 6]]
```

Latin squares have many practical uses, for example in error-correcting-codes and the design of agricultural
experiments. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square for more details. Sudoku is a special type of 9 x 9 latin
square, with additional conditions.
