# [Find the unique number](https://www.codewars.com/kata/find-the-unique-number-1 "https://www.codewars.com/kata/585d7d5adb20cf33cb000235")

There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

```
Kata.findUniq(new double[]{ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 }); // => 2
Kata.findUniq(new double[]{ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 }); // => 0.55
```


Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.
