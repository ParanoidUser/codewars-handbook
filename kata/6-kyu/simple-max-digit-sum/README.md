# [Simple max digit sum](https://www.codewars.com/kata/simple-max-digit-sum "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b162ed4c8c47ea2f5000023")

In this Kata, you will be given an integer `n` and your task will be to return `the largest integer that is <= n and has the highest digit sum`.

For example:
```
solve(100) = 99. Digit Sum for 99 = 9 + 9 = 18. No other number <= 100 has a higher digit sum.
solve(10) = 9
solve(48) = 48. Note that 39 is also an option, but 48 is larger.
```

Input range is `0 < n < 1e11`
