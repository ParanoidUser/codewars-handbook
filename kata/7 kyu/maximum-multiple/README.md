# Input >> Output Examples 

```
maxMultiple (2,7) ==> return (6)
```
## Explanation: 

**_(6)_** is divisible by **_(2)_** , **_(6)_** is less than or equal to bound **_(7)_** , and **_(6)_** is > 0 .
___
```
maxMultiple (10,50)  ==> return (50)
```
## Explanation:

**_(50)_** *is divisible by* **_(10)_** , **_(50)_** is less than or equal to bound **_(50)_** , and **_(50)_** is > 0 .*
___
```
maxMultiple (37,200) ==> return (185)
```
## Explanation:

**_(185)_** is divisible by **_(37)_** , **_(185)_** is less than or equal to bound **_(200)_** , and **_(185)_** is > 0 .

Java's default return statement can be any `int`, a divisor **will** be found.
